## 🚨 **NEW: Prompt System Improvement Plan** (2025-11-12)

Comprehensive plan to improve the research tool's prompt system - addressing rigidity, over-complication, and insufficient user intent prioritization.

### Quick Start

1. **[PROMPT_IMPROVEMENTS_SUMMARY.md](./PROMPT_IMPROVEMENTS_SUMMARY.md)** ⭐ **START HERE** (5 min read)
   - Executive summary of the problem and solution
   - Expected impact and quick decision framework

2. **[PROMPT_IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md](./PROMPT_IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md)** (25 pages)
   - Complete strategic analysis and root cause analysis
   - Detailed improvement plans for each phase
   - Risk mitigation and success metrics

3. **[PROMPT_IMPROVEMENTS_VISUAL_COMPARISON.md](./PROMPT_IMPROVEMENTS_VISUAL_COMPARISON.md)** (20 pages)
   - Side-by-side before/after comparisons for each phase
   - Concrete examples showing improvements

4. **[PROMPT_IMPROVEMENT_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md](./PROMPT_IMPROVEMENT_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md)** (30 pages)
   - Step-by-step implementation with specific file changes
   - Testing protocols and rollback procedures
   - Complete implementation checklist

**Key Findings:** 60% complexity reduction needed. User intent should be first, not buried. Phase 3 needs major simplification (132→50 lines).
