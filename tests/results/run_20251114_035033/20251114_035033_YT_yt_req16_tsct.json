  "content": "hello everybody are McKinsey BCG Bain at the risk  of losing their greatness in 2021 2022 just like all the other big tech companies McKinsey BCG Bain  have also seen increase in revenues but 2023 just like all the big tech companies they also faced  a reality check and unfortunately unlike the big tech companies which could go ahead and Bank on  the AI Boom the Consulting companies do not have that kind of Leverage and in fact if the AI boom  continues to grow then Consulting companies are potentially at a risk before we dig deep into  understanding what are the factors that could potentially lead to this kind of a decline let's  first understand where do these companies stand what do they do if you look at the Consulting  companies their overall objective is to support their clients other companies and what are the  various ways in which they can consult and support let's look at one extreme end of the spectrum  that is specialized Niche consulting firms these are working only in one area for example they  might be doing operations support or supply chain Consulting in the mining industry or any such  kind of Niche area or we can call them as Rocket scientists of that area and truly so it is hard to  replace these guys because they have expertise in that domain and they are building that expertise  and reputation over a very long time frame now that's category one on the other end of the  spectrum we can see implementation Partners or Consultants who come in and help their clients  Implement stuff that's already being decided this bucket can consist of let's say for IT services  TCS vpro infosis a lot of these guys also have their Consulting arms and majority of the  Consulting work goes into this implementation work and in the middle spectrum is where McKenzie BCG  Bane and other strategy Consulting companies like their objective is to help the CEO CFO or the C-  level Executives the leadership of the teams make the right decisions and how do they do that they  go through the entire organization get the data what is required do that analysis help the company  make that quick decisions this is one big part of the job I'm not saying this is the only part  of the job but this is a huge part of course a lot of companies do not know what is the right  question to ask so they help in structuring the problem going and doing the data analysis and then  shaping the strategy of the company for the next 5 years 10 years or the immediate next 3 months  however this revolution of AI can help the clients do this entire data analysis way way quickly and  that is the reason why this disruption for the entire Consulting industry could be different from  the disruptions in 2008 the financial crisis and 2020 the pandemic and even 20 ,000 the.com bubble  so all these bubbles they could get over it in fact much more strongly but this is remarkably  different so we have to wait and watch how the AI Evolution will play out now that we understand  what Consulting companies like McKenzie BCG Bane do at a very high level determining or supporting  and shaping the strategy of the firms the next part is what are some of the factors that are  pushing these companies into potential decline one of the reasons is globalization yes let me  repeat it globalization Consulting companies like McKenzie BCG Bane or even if I get ahead and  involve the big Force even PWC deoe all these guys also have strong Consulting arms deoe for example  has their presence in 150 countries McKenzie also has a huge presence across the globe when I worked  at McKenzie I was in the US office but when there was a need in Indonesian office for a specific  type of project I was pulled into that project so the global networks were a strength that they  could pull in people from different parts of the world and execute a project to the best of their  abilities at a very short span but now this Global Network for every single company is acting against  them how and why if you think about China McKenzie apparently has helped China in designing their  Vision 2025 make in China 2025 and hence a lot of us lawmakers are against for McKenzie to go  ahead and work on government projects previously they used to confidently boost about hey we have  worked in China we have worked in Europe and we collectively can bring a lot more of experience  but now that's not the case anymore in fact Bane employees in the Shanghai office were questioned  by Chinese administration now these kind of things were not common a few years back and it's not just  about China it is also about McKinsey BCG Bain and all these Consulting companies involvement in  Saudi Arabia so is globalization really important or is it really really detrimental for Consulting  companies is a big question mark now the second thing is with respect to the prioritization of how  the corporate world is moving through a certain factors for example sustainability was on top of  the agenda for a lot of companies in 2020 2021 2022 but come 2023 and 2024 when the macroeconomic  factors themselves were changing they said sustainability is not important for me anymore  it is 10th in the priority list which means it is not important at all so what these guys did all  the Consulting companies in 2021 2022 were they acquired a lot of these sustainability related  companies so that they built that expertise and support clients now what happens to the future of  sustainability again a big big question mark the third factor is of course the a factor but how  is that playing out previously if two companies are merging right they had to have a consultant  from these big Consulting organizations doing a lot of analysis which is typically called as  due diligence you can go ahead Google the word due diligence and you will understand what it  means from a consulting or an M&A mergers and Acquisitions context now a lot of these mergers  and Acquisitions based analysis are automated through web scraping tools through chatbots  and hence the Consulting companies have also started adopting collaborations with different  AI companies out there now the best of the best have already come together Bane is collaborating  with open AI BCG is collaborating with anthropic Accenture is collaborating with Microsoft and of  course McKenzie has a few Acquisitions under its radar now all these are fine but there is a big  question mark again once the clients the company are comfortable with this AI Revolution and they  themselves can use these artificial intelligence chat boards now what is the purpose of going  to McKenzie BCG or Bane and then using these AI tools can't they directly go to Silicon Valley  and start subscribing to these tools instead of a five member Consulting team they can have just  one person who is working with the chatbot to do all the analysis and just helping frame the  question itself that's a very very very realistic probability and which is not a good sign for the  Consulting companies and that's one of the reasons why Consulting companies are also getting into  layoffs now we do not know if this disruption is a genuine threat or arguably for the greatness  of these Consulting companies now this could be one of the fundamental disruptions and could  lead to the risk of losing that greatness or arguably the greatness of these consulting firms  but are the Consulting companies just sitting idle and not doing anything of course not not only just  collaborating with different AI Partners they are moving forward in a way where they are not just  providing the solutions through their Consultants going and sitting at the client side they are  taking a product Le Consulting approach they are building products themselves and saying that  hey you deploy this product and I will go ahead and support you through this product so instead  of five Consultants we ourselves recommend only one consultant and a product for which you pay  a subscription fee this is a very interesting time ahead for the Consulting industry and I will  let you know how this industry is moving forward through my own conversations with my friends from  McKenzie my classmates at incad who then went into Consulting companies if you want me to do these  kind of deep dives into different Industries which can help you understand how to read an  industry how you can shape your career if you are in that industry and if you are interested in  that industry do let me know in the comments and do do let me know in the comments what are those  three takeaways for you which you believe can lead to the downfall of Consulting industry  see you again guys in the next one bye-bye hello
