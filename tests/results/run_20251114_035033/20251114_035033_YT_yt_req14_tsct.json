  "content": "all right everyone welcome back to the channel the reason you clicked this video is because you want to know the difference between management consulting and strategy Consulting and that's exactly what you're going to learn by the end of this video and it's important for you to know the difference between the two because they can lead you down completely different paths in life and one of these careers will be better for you depending on your goals and your personality I've helped over 600 people land their dream consulting jobs and over that time I've been able to recognize which Consulting careers are best for different types of people so sit back relax and tap that like button if you appreciate my hard work on this content alright let's dive in I'm going to cover the difference between the work that they do the compensation they receive the lifestyle as well as which one is the better career path in the world of Consulting there is no Consulting that can be done if there's no business that hires these Consultants so when you look at a business a business really breaks down to two things what are we gonna do and how we're gonna do it and this is where strategy Consulting and management consulting fits in so if a company he hires a strategy consultant a strategy consultant basically fits the first question which is what do we work on while the management consulting deals with both what we work on and how we work on it in other words all strategy Consultants are management Consultants but not all management Consultants are strategy consultants and this comes into the type of work that you do as well as who you work with because strategy Consultants think about the Strategic picture of what we do they oftentimes will work with the executives so think about the CEO the CFO the CEO and all the other cxo roles out there so they're going to work with the highest level of the company once the strategy is decided then non-strategy management Consultants will come in and figure out with the company how to do this so to management Consultants who aren't working on a strategy will likely work with the VPS the directors and the heads of the businesses and divisions so that's pretty much how you can think about the strategy Consultants as well as the management consultants and the different types of work that they do and who they work with but the easiest way to understand this is actually to go through an example so imagine that Dwayne The Rock Johnson who happens to own a tequila brand called terramatta true fact and tiramana right now is currently in 150 countries exactly let's imagine that the rock as well as the CEO of the tequila company wanted to know well we're in 150 countries now but which country should be number 151 so what they'll do is they'll hire a team of strategy Consultants let's say that they hire a strategy consultant from Bain and what they will do is the main team will come in do some analysis and they'll realize that based on all of this we recommend that you launch next in Thailand so now that the company the rock the CEO know that they want to launch in Thailand the question becomes how do they launch in Thailand so then the strategy consultant's work is done so the next phase is they need to hire non-strategy management Consultants to come in and figure out all the other pieces how do we actually do this so for example they might bring in a Management Consultant who specializes in supply chain so they can figure out how to get the tequila from all the countries it's currently in where it's being created to Thailand it might bring in a Management Consultant who specializes in sales to figure out how do they build their sales team in Thailand third they might bring in a Management Consultant who specializes in risk for example to assess well what are the risks how do we work with the Thai government are there black markets how do we counteract fakes that might be in the market as well so as you can see here strategy Consultants focus on the strategy part but management Consultants can work on the strategy as well as all the other parts of the business so management Consultants as a result can be across various different things and this example shows you one of many examples of how management consultants and strategy Consultants provide value to companies that they work with but now that you know the work that they do and who they work with what is the compensation like so overall strategy Consultants will be paid roughly about 20 to 30 percent more than management Consultants but remember the term management consulting is pretty wide that means that on average management Consultants who aren't doing strategy work will be paid less but there are also management Consultants who are paid more than strategy Consultants on average but why does this happen why do some management consultants get paid higher than strategy Consultants well it comes down to two things first off is is there an expertise that's very rare for example imagine that you went to your general doctor's visit and a doctor says hey you have this really rare disease who are you gonna go see you're probably gonna go see a specialist but imagine that there's only four specialists in the world who know about your disease you're probably going to have to search them out and they're going to charge a lot because they don't get a lot of patience so they have to be able to compensate through the few people that they have but because that knowledge is very valued and very few people have it they can charge more so this is the same in management consulting which is that if you have an extra expertise that's very rare but that people want to be able to use you can charge more as a result the project costs more and a management Consultants who have this knowledge will cost more as well so that's how the compensation for management Consultants can be hired the second way that a management is only can earn more than the strategy consultant is if the knowledge and the work that they do would be costly if it was done incorrectly or wrong so imagine for example that the client is an oil company and they want to dig for oil offshore well they have to be able to put in the safety precautions so that their employees and their team members are safe because if they don't do it then one someone could die to the pr that results from it it's going to tank the company's value but also third it's going to put other people's lives at risk as well so a lot is at stake if they get it wrong so Management Consultant who specializes in the oil industry and in particular with HR and compliance and safety they're going to be able to charge a lot more because because they know that if the oil company gets it wrong it's going to cost the company a lot more money than what they're paying for the Consultants so those are the two ways that some management Consultants are able to make more than a strategy consultant but just because strategy Consultants on average make more money it doesn't mean that their life or their work is better in fact for a lot of strategy Consultants compared to their non-strategy Management Consultant counterparts they work a lot more hours so work life matters to you this is something to keep in mind so on average strategy Consultants at firms like McKinsey Bain and Boston Consulting Group will work on average 50 to 60 hours per week of course there are some projects that will require more than 60 but on average if you look at a career and look at all your sample size it's going to work out to be about 50 to 60 hours so how does this compare to their management consulting counterparts who aren't working in strategy well on the whole these Consultants work anywhere between 45 to 55 hours so you're seeing a vibriety here because a lot of the work life in Consulting varies depending on three factors it depends on the project it depends on the timeline and it depends on the client for example if you have a project that the firm has never done before there's less knowledge for you to leverage in desk T so you're learning on a job as well versus if a project has been done thousands of times you probably have templates and models that you can leverage second is the timeline if you have six months to come up with a strategy versus six days that's gonna vary a lot in terms of how intense the work is and third is the client because if the client is calling you with other work and calling you at 2 am that's going to extend your time or if you have to fly to the client site that adds more time because you have to travel to and from the airport and actually take the plane there versus if you have a client for a product you've done thousands of times before the timeline is very generous and the client doesn't want you on site the hours will be lower so again it really depends but on average you can assume that a strategy consultant will work a lot more hours so now you know the work between a management consulting and strategy consultant the compensation as well as the work-life balance which career path is the right career path for you and there is a right answer so when I advise the candidates who end up getting multiple offers and they have to decide between well do I want to be a strategy consultant or do I want to be a Management Consultant and within management consulting do I actually want to take strategy roles or do I want to take non-strategy roles or do I want to make sure both because what you decide is going to affect your career so how do you think through this there's one question that I advise everyone asks themselves and it's this what do you want to do after Consulting because the answer is going to tell you a lot about what you should do if you want to work at a large company let's say you want to be president or CEO of a large company like Google or Starbucks then I recommend strategy Consulting because as a strategy consultant you're going to get exposure to the high level the c-suite that you're going to want to be one day and you're going to get exposure to really difficult problems that these companies are solving and this is going to come in handy when you become a leader within your organization currently the CEO at Google and the CEO at Starbucks for both former strategy consultants and there's a good reason for that second is if you want to remain in operations or potentially even start your own company it's okay to go down the non-strategy management consulting route in fact there are a lot of advantages to it yeah why while strategy Consultants will set the strategy they're oftentimes not involved into implementation itself so what this means is that their management consulting counterparts tend to have a lot more operational experience so in the early days of a startup or when a company is relying on its operations you're going to need a lot more operational know-how than strategic know-how because the strategy might change day to day depending on what's happening but you still need to get from point A to point B and this is why a lot of companies the same ones I mentioned Google and Starbucks when they first started relied a lot on former management Consultants who had operational experience and then later on when they grew they would hire a lot more strategy Consultants who are leaving these firms and want a strategic role within the company but what happens if you don't know what you want to do after Consulting for example you don't know if you want to work for a large company you don't know if you want to work in operations you don't know if you want to start a company you don't even know what you want to do tomorrow well in that case I recommend strategy Consulting because as a strategy consultant you're going to be able to see multiple projects across different Industries different verticals and different functions and that way you can decide what you like and don't like in fact that was one of the advantages I had when I was at Bain which was when I took on strategic projects I got a chance to see different Industries and some I really gravitated towards like education While others like oil and gas didn't resonate as much with me and so this helped me decide what I wanted to do and in fact if you don't understand what you want to do and there's a chance that you might want to stay in Consulting forever having a strategy consultant background helps you even if you're going to move into an operational role later all these skills are going to be transferable so that's how I recommend it is think about what do you want to do after Consulting so now you know the difference between management consulting and strategy consulting which is going to help you with the recruiting process but also once you become a consultant help you navigate your career if you're 100 serious about becoming a consultant whether it's a strategy consultant or Management Consultant I want to help you get there my team and I at my Consulting offer aware of team of former
