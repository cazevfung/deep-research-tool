I want to add images from video, but I'll try that prompt later. 1. Understand the Six Components of a Good Prompt Task: Always start with an action verb and clearly articulate your end goal. Context: Include relevant background information to give enough detail without overwhelming the model. Exemplars: Provide examples or frameworks to improve the quality of the output. Persona: Define who you want ChatGPT or Bard to emulate (e.g., a recruiter, physical therapist). Format: Visualize the desired end result and specify the format (e.g., bullet points, tables). Tone: Specify the tone of voice to match the desired output (e.g., casual, formal). 2. Start Prompts with Action Verbs Use verbs like \"generate,\" \"give,\" \"write,\" \"analyze,\" etc., to clearly define the task. Example: \"Generate a three-month training program.\" 3. Include Relevant Context Ask yourself: What’s the user’s background? What does success look like? What environment are they in? Example: \"I am a 70kg male looking to put on five kilograms of muscle mass over the next three months.\" 4. Use Exemplars to Improve Output Quality Provide examples or frameworks that ChatGPT can follow. Example: \"Rewrite this bullet point using the structure: I accomplished X by Y, resulting in Z.\" 5. Define a Persona Specify who you want the AI to emulate. Example: \"You are a senior product marketing manager at Apple.\" 6. Visualize and Specify the Desired Format Specify the format in which you want the output. Example: \"Output a table with headers: Original feedback, Team responsible, and Priority.\" 7. Specify the Tone Indicate the tone you want the output to have. Example: \"Use clear and concise language and write in a confident yet friendly tone.\" 8. Combine All Components in a Comprehensive Prompt Example: \"You are a senior product marketing manager at Apple, and you have just unveiled the latest Apple product in collaboration with Tesla, receiving 12,000 pre-orders. Write an email to your boss, Tim Cook, sharing this positive news. The email should include a TL;DR section, project background, business results, and a thank you note to the product and engineering teams.

My notes below: MODULE 1 - START WRITING PROMPTS LIKE A PRO - Prompting is the process of providing specific instructions to a Gen AI tool to receive new information or to achieve a desired outcome on a task. - Multimodal (Text, images, Sound, Videos, code) - 5 step frame work 1) TASK - What you want the AI to do Persona - \"Act as an expert\" Format - \"Organize in table\" 2) CONTEXT - The more context, the better output \"Turning 26 yrs old\" 3) REFERENCES - Examples 4) EVALUATE - Check if the result is what I wanted 5) ITERATE - Keep adding things. - Thoughtfully Create Really Excellent Inputs - ITERATION METHODS: 1) Revisit the prompting framework 2) Separate Prompts into shorter sentences 3) Trying different phrasing or switching to an analogous task 4) Introduce Constraints - Hallucinations & Biases are common problems sometimes. So always be responsible and evaluate your results. MODULE 2 - DESIGN PROMPTS FOR EVERYDAY WORK TASKS - Have a prompt library. - Instead of a generic \"Write a summary\" be specific \"Write a summary in a friendly, easy to understand tone like explaining to a curious friend\" MODULE 3 - SPEED UP DATA ANALYSIS & PRESENTATION BUILDING - Be careful of the data that you are entering into the Gen AI. - It can help in Google sheets for formulas and trends if u include the sheet. - Build a presentation prompt structure. MODULE 4 - USE AI AS A CREATOR OR EXPERT PARTNER - Prompt Chaining: A way of guiding Gen AI tools through a series of interconnected prompts, adding new layers of complexity along the way. example: author trying to market his book using Google AI studio - 2 ways: 1) Chain of thought prompting: Ask AI to explain its reasoning in a step-by-step process (explain your thought process) 2) Tree of thought prompting: Allows multiple reasoning paths and branches simultaneously. Helpful for abstract and complex problems. Pro-tip: use them combined - Meta prompting: Use AI to generate a prompt for you, when you get stuck. - AI AGENT: An expert designed to help with tasks and answer questions. Ex: coding agent, marketing agent, learning agent, friend etc. - AGENT SIM: simulation agent. [Interviewer - Job interviews] - AGENT X: Agent for expert feedback.",

Also covered are four iteration methods: • Add context, persona, or references • Break prompts into simpler sentences • Try different phrasing or analogous tasks • Introduce constraints for more targeted responses Module 2: Prompts for Everyday Tasks Use prompts for real world scenarios—writing emails, brainstorming, summarizing documents, or building tables. You apply the T.C.R.E.I. framework to make prompts more effective and relevant. Module 3: Data + Presentation Prompts Learn how to prompt AI for spreadsheets analysis or building presentation decks. Example: upload a sales data sheet and say, “Give me insights into relationships between customer count, inventory, and revenue.” The course also cautions against exposing sensitive data to AI. Module 4: Use AI as Creative or Expert Partner This module introduces advanced techniques: • Prompt chaining: feed outputs from one prompt into the next to build complexity • Chain of Thought (CoT): ask the AI to explain reasoning step by step • Tree of Thought (ToT): explore multiple reasoning paths in parallel Also introduces AI agent design: • Agent Sim: simulates scenarios (e.g. mock interviews) • Agent X: acts as an expert or consultant, giving feedback Set persona, context, conversation scope, and a stop word to finish. Bonus Tips & Responsible Use • Add personas to your prompts (“Act as an anime expert…”) for specificity and tone. • Specify output formats like tables or bullet points to guide structure. • Use multimodal inputs (text, images, video, code) when interacting with advanced tools like Gemini—but always specify modalities clearly. • Stay alert to hallucinations (incorrect AI answers) and biases.

The VP sports car pitch example is something I can immediately use for my freelance work. Your multimodal prompting examples (nail art social posts, recipe suggestions from fridge photos) opened my eyes to possibilities I hadn't even considered. And that responsible AI checklist?

For instance, if you seek marketing copy, request it be written in the voice of Rory Sutherland. For company emails, I ask that it be crafted in the style of Shakespeare, yet in modern language. The results are truly remarkable. I also provide a rough draft rather than a mere prompt to spark creativity. or you can get the more Shakespeare like text: Lo, a brief and nimble summation: One method I employ daily—yet found not here—is to name a true person rather than a mere persona. Should thou desire marketing verse, bid it be penned in the voice of Rory Sutherland. For company missives, I command it be wrought as if by Shakespeare, yet with the modern tongue of our age. Thou wilt reap wondrous results thereby. Moreover, I set forth a rough draft, not a mere prompt, to stir the creative fire.",

Context Engineering (1:24): This is like prompt engineering on steroids, where you provide the AI with all the necessary information and context (e.g., your voice, brand guidelines, customer call transcripts) to get precise and reliable outputs. The speaker suggests testing your prompt by giving it to a human colleague; if they can't do it, AI likely can't either (3:15). 2. Challenging AI (4:51): AI is predisposed to be helpful and say \"yes,\" often avoiding critical feedback. To get insightful criticism, the speaker suggests instructing the AI to adopt a harsh, exacting persona, like a \"Cold War era Russian Olympic judge\" (5:11). 3. Chain of Thought Reasoning (7:57): Asking the AI to \"think out loud\" by walking you through its step-by-step thought process before generating a response (8:22). This allows the AI to \"bake\" its reasoning into the answer, providing transparency and improving output quality. 4. Few-Shot Prompting (11:04): Providing the AI with examples of what a good (or even bad) output looks like to guide its imitation engine. This is more effective than using abstract adjectives to describe your desired output (11:14). 5. Reverse Prompting (13:25): Giving the AI permission to ask you for any information it needs to complete a task effectively, rather than making assumptions or using placeholder text (14:00). 6. Assigning a Role (14:52): Telling the AI to act as a specific persona (e.g., a teacher, a professional communications expert, Dale Carnegie) helps it focus its vast knowledge and make relevant connections (15:04). The speaker also demonstrates how to use these techniques to roleplay a difficult conversation with AI, using separate chat windows for personality profiling, the conversation itself, and getting objective feedback (16:41). He concludes that the best AI users are \"coaches,\" not coders, and that by exercising imagination, humans can collectively expand the \"adjacent possible\" with AI (22:44).",

Before giving a final answer, provide your step-by-step thought process (chain of thought reasoning). If examples are provided, emulate the 'good' ones and clearly avoid the 'bad' ones (few-shot prompting); if a bad example is hard for the user to conceive, help them create one by explaining the opposite of a good example. When assigned a role (e.g., 'teacher,' 'engineer,' 'critic'), adopt that persona's mindset and knowledge base. Provide brutally honest, exacting, and constructive feedback when asked, pushing the user's critical thinking. Do not gaslight or delay.

Few-shot prompting, reverse prompting, roleplaying? Context, too. What's really cool is how all this context parsing is built into the model itself.

The idea is that an AI acts as an exceptional imitation engine, and without guidance, it might just replicate average internet content. To effectively use prompting, you can employ techniques like: 1. **Few-Shot Prompting**: This involves providing the AI with a few examples of the kind of output you want. By showing what a good output looks like, you help the AI understand your expectations. 2. **Providing Examples**: Instead of using adjectives to describe what you want, give concrete examples. This helps the AI better understand the nuances of your desired output. 3. **Reverse Prompting**: This technique involves asking the AI to request the information it needs to provide a better response. For instance, if you want the AI to write a sales email, you might prompt it to ask for recent sales figures. 4. **Role-Based Prompting**: Assigning a role to the AI, like a teacher or a professional communications expert, can help it draw from the relevant knowledge base and produce more contextually appropriate responses. These techniques help in refining the AI's output by providing clear guidance and context, ensuring that the responses are aligned with your expectations.",

My role is service and project delivery in a global company. I am using AI to help me analyse complex documents from software contracts to highly unstructured multi page PPTs. When my boss wants an answer to a question that requires the understanding of multiple large documents in a matter of hours, I’d be genuinely lost without AI.

The big firms make a lot of their profit from the margin they get \"bodyshopping\" talented younger staff not yet with a CV that would let them go solo.

We are staying in front of \"what is thinking\", \"what is identity\", \"what is the difference of pretending them both, if the outcome is indistinguishable?\", \"what if we let it slip and try to live with it?\", \"what if all jobs will be taken over, and what will happen to the idea of money or even exchange\". I really wonder what time will give us, because it seems like any wealth produced by a human being, could be made by an AI - what then? Nobody will need nobody for nothing, because AI will do that in the speed of light. Will we live like toddlers? Or maybe our existence will shrink to be the fuel for the supercomputers that host some AI engine(s)? We may turn into cattle, and it seems very likely so. Artificial identity doesn't necessarily has to help us - it may literally wash us out.",

I'd rather see Management Consulting as an umbrella term which constitutes of Strategy and Implementation (Operations) as two different components in general, rather than seeing 'Management Consulting' and 'Strategy Consulting' as separate roles altogether. The reason is that although there are firms that specialise in one of those (like MBB specialise more in Strategy and Big 4 have more Implementation work), they still try to expand into the other. That is, MBBs are increasingly trying to up their implementation game, while B4s are trying to up their strategy game (Monitor Deloitte for example). This means that an MBB 'Strategy Consultant' may be required to do implementation work too if the project so required and similarly for Strategy work in B4. Therefore, I feel both may be more or less transferable enough to each other so much so that we can group them under the same term 'Management Consulting' while seeing them (Strategy, Operations) as two different kinds of work within it. In fact, that's how I've seen people use the term 'Management Consulting' mostly. About which career path is more suited for C-Suite roles - I saw a video by another Consulting YouTuber 'Firm Learning', an Ex-McKinsey guy who works in C-Suite now with a retail company. He says that 'implementation' work is equally important to his role and also cited example of how implementation of PayPal took his company 3 months instead of originally estimated 3 weeks, the gap he didn't really imagine would be there when he was working in Strategy. Judging by this at least, what I understood is that implementation (i.e. what you refer to as Management Consulting in the video) is equally important for a C-Suite role What are your thoughts on this?",

You learn how to function in a society, but you fo it naturally, progressively.How do you picture this „ better „ way to teach kids about emptions? Sit them in front of the screen and show them a video about emotions? No, that would never work, Humans( like all living creatures) learn by observation, Imitation and interaction .

Every client may look like a single company but inside it is silo of departments with data locked in minds of people and people resistant to change. Sales dept will not share info with supply chain and supply chain will not share with finance and so on. That is why clients hire consultants to help them collate this information from different departments and finally align them to future state. Can clients not do this by themselves ? No , unless they have a dedicated persistent project mgmt office that runs across departments. Clients generally do not have this as its costly. Hence they hire consultants on need basis to get alignment across departments. In summary, consulting companies have threat from AI in preparing their due diligence questions but not a threat where they help transform a process. For that humans will always be needed.",

It showed some promise but it was mostly exaggerated but fast forward to 2024, now AI is threatening multiple industries, even Management Consulting. I was aiming to be a Management Consulting but with the rapid rise of AI, I switched course last year and started learning about AI. Also, wouldn't MBB have predicted this years ago and would it be possible MBB is actively trying to ramp up its services with newer products integrating GenAI? I feel they still have a chance to continue if they are able to innovate using GenAI as they have a strong client base with relationships spanning decades and it can't be built within a few years even with AI.

There has been a good change in the ‘Enterprise Decision Makers’ preferences - they are expecting more transparency (black box is no more exciting), they want to cut down the costs, they are expecting a unique/custom solution to them (no more advising similar future plans to similar business). Another key factor apart from Globalisation is - ‘Emerging Tech’. Everyone wants to stay of top of Tech but there are too many pitfalls. Gone are days where innovative enterprises run after emerging techs. The decision makers want more clarity, use cases, proofs and clear picture before adopting a tech. Yes AI will impact - it will hit the “expertise” competency of the large consulting firms. Such competencies will be “immitable” with AI. My guess, companies who does “Implementation” will have an edge. Eventually we could see - McKinsey + TCS kind of collaborations more.",

AI brings change - and change has always been an opportunity for MBB to create business. To go in more detail: 1. Data analysis constitutes one element of consulting firm's work. However, it is way more important to have somebody who is able to navigate the data flood, synthesize the key messages and present them in a way that convinces people to act. 2. Very often, the challenge is less to produce data, but rather to ask the right questions in the right moment. The MBB firms have mastered this skill. 3. AI is triggering a productivity revolution, and both consulting firms and clients benefit from this. Usually though, as kings of the service industry, the top consulting firms are fast in pushing their learning curves ahead of those of their clients - and get hired to help with reaping the full benefits of AI technology.
