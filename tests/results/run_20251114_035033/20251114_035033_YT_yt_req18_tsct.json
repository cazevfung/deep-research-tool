  "content": "okay hello everyone and welcome back to my video podcast on the future of Business and Technology and today I want to dive into a use case of how Global consulting firm BCG is using AI internally um and to help me do this I have with me Vlad lukage who is the managing director and Senior partner Global leader Tech and digital advantage and also co-lead bcg's AI at scale offering globally welcome Vlad nice to see you thanks for having me yeah so where are you joining us from today I'm in New York on the road lovely on the road um so maybe we can start by exploring the importance of AI to B BCG so how important is it and especially the importance of generative Ai and and and how it how you believe it will transform um the Consulting industry and how important is it to you today as a business listen I think it's it gets into the Crux of our business right and it's going to be fundamental to the toolkit and skills that we uh need to have I I would see it more as um an assistant that is giving us another superpower right to move at a different level of speed than we have in the past um and that allows us to get to the right conversations even faster right so we are all about BCG on generating the right and differentiated Insight right from the data that's available to everyone right and then driving companies to impact so for that I need to be able to digest as much as I can distill to the essence right and implications and the right Insight from it and then move the companies in in motion as quickly as possible right and generative AI as one of the tools in that toolkit uh can help us with both of those objectives very good so maybe you can take us through some examples of how you're currently using AI within BCG and and in particular generative AI yeah so I'll give you I was just thinking uh as you know were talking about potential questions right uh the um my summer internship at BCG there was a moment where I had to interview 30 Engineers on a specific type of um uh metal and and and and composits uh materials um and I had to do that in a period of three days and then I conducted all of those I recorded them then I was transcribing them for a couple of days then I was rereading them trying to distill the insights then I was making slides like that whole process took probably two weeks right now I was just working with my consultant that did a similar exercise where in those in a similar period of two days conducted 20 30 interviews the difference is now on the third day he had slides and insights ready to go I was like what did you do he said well as I was doing them I was uploading them into our Enterprise GPT um and and it helped me quickly transcribe them and distill the key points and then um I haded to pick up on the key themes and he had a starting point of a draft within minutes as he finished those and then he took a day to like refine them and make sure that it really captured all the key sites right and then he used the tools to make slides out of it that we're ready to engage on so it just took something that was a twoe process down to two three days right um and so it just it's really helping us move to a different level of speed now it also allows us to much earlier in the process engage on the insights from those conversations so like this didn't mean now we're done with work in three days this actually now teed up a whole new layer of next level of questions that that the individual is now proceeding with right and doing the Deep Dives in so the level of that speed allows us to now go even deeper than we have in the past right um and I think with the markets and general knowledge increasing of everyone for us to stay our competitive advantages that we go deeper than anyone else this allows us to go there so I don't know if that resonates as an as a example of which we have plenty no it's a great example you you you mentioned this Enterprise GPT so tell me more about this so how is this rolled out to every single person within BCG um how are they using it um are there any restrictions on it yeah so listen we've developed we've rolled it out to everyone at BCG everyone has access to it it is our Enterprise um license all of our data remains um uh within our control we've also taken it to the next level with um the controls that if you use it in a specific project for a specific client all of the conversations and all the IP developed for that remain available just to the folks within that project right so that it cannot be seen uh by others nor can others benefit from the new brain right that was trained on this data so we put a lot of constraints in how it can be used right within the right context um so that's one piece of it um the second one is we've allowed uh our Consultants to build their own gpts right for their specific engagements and for their specific clients so we have I think we have over two and a half or 3,000 gpts that were built uh and we have a little bit of a we have a leaderboard uh where you can see which ones are being used the most Etc and it's interesting a lot of them that I use the most are directly related to the work right so summaries of the documents summaries of um uh like of the publicly available research right so they're trained on doing those types of things much faster so that would be very much in line with the example that I gave then we have a number of them that are simplifying some of the administrative tasks like um um when we travel a lot we need to figure out our time sheets right and where we spend the time Etc that can sometimes take you back into your calendar to review things and like try to account for it uh this can pick it up immediately and like within seconds give you the overview of how you should report your time sheets Etc so there's a number of administrative gpts that teams have built to actually speed up some of the administrative parts of the of your tasks yeah so that's um um a little bit of a flavor for it very good and so you you described that in the past it would take you to two weeks to to to transcribe interviews to really distill some of the the insights from it to package it up to and and you would argue that they are core skills of a good consultant with GPT taking over some of those roles how do you see the roles of Consultants evolve in the future what skills will really matter more than ever and and how do we how do you prepare your your Workforce for this new reality yeah so let's take your your question even a step further let's say now most senior people can use GPT or you know one of the uh uh tools available uh instead of using an associate or a consultant someone Junior because it can do some of this work right for them and do that for five years well that means in five years you didn't train the next wave of the senior folks that know how to sanity check the materials Etc so what we are doing now is thinking through pushing that as much as we can and then in parallel thinking through purposeful toil right where do we put checks in the workflow that Force the individual consultant to actually digest the materials sanity check them and have an interaction with someone senior that can help them build intuition for sanity checking and digesting these materials right so that's a new moment for all of us right what I'm super happy about is is that we are really on The Cutting Edge of trying these different things right and we're learning these things that we now need to feed back into our workflows right so um long-winded answer Bernard um but what we're trying to do is create still the rhythm of our regular meetings right sometimes it's on a weekly basis sometimes it's twice a week on reviewing specific content so that those checkpoints remain and that we are forcing some of those conversations with our team members right so that we can build their skills along the way and to your specific question the skills around um uh understanding how these things work and how they reason becomes extremely important because then you can look at the fail points um in what they are summarizing or what they're suggesting right as a potential answer two um knowing enough um teaching folks on what good looks like so they have a point of reference to Quality check what's coming in three knowing how to engage the experts in the field to again help them sanity check the outputs and help teach them how to write the right prompts to get the most the most accurate answers a simple example is from um few of our um Consultants that are focused on coding and development we have a whole unit that is focused on building uh we're finding a very huge difference in um using co-pilots for coding uh when our people when people are experienced versus not for example inexperienced person will just ask for 20 30 lines of code at a time the experienced person will never ask for more than five lines of code at a time because they can sanity check it the prompts work and then making sure they talk to each other and that the junior ones learn about that is a skill that we need to build for the organization and for them to learn how to do so those are just examples of the interventions we're putting in and types of skills that we need to build very good and I believe you run a big scientific experiment to measure the impact of generative AI on performance and efficiency involving 750 employees do you want to share that experience with us and maybe give us an overview of of what the results were yeah so we've we've done that piece and now since we've done couple others that are going going to be published in the next few days so stay tuned you will as soon as you have it you'll be among the first ones to get it uh but um the experiment we ran was we gave we we we pulled out um a number of Consultants 750 of them uh and gave them specific tasks um to um to conduct right from the regular workflow either doing a summary or doing a piece of analysis or doing piece of market research um and we had them use enter gpts as a tool and mandated that their answer needs to be come by using it right and then we had a control group that was supposed to conduct the same task without using any of the tools so just using the traditional approach um and we were then comparing right uh the outcomes and few things we found um the for the more straightforward tasks right that don't have a lot of complexity and the data quality is pretty high um the new hires uh the ramp up to the productivity of experienced Consultants was dramatic that their productivity was boosted 30 40% so it worked really well and for the experienced folks that are uh that have been doing the job their productivity went up by 20 30% because they're already pretty fast but this boosted them to be even faster um in in what they were doing so we've seen for sure uh specific Improvement in the productivity and then we've seen the inverse on really complex tasks so if we asked to do some calculations right or if we asked the gener AI uh tools to um to do mathematical ex you know math right or to derve An Answer u in a in a complex question we saw that productivity of the junior folks went down 340% they were less productive and some of the more experienced folks productivity was either flat or went slightly down and the reason was in the complex tasks when a junior person asked like the example that I gave you the line number of lines of code right here if it has to do I don't know give me the market size of something in a specific country based on the data over the last four years um and if the number comes wrong unpacking why it's wrong and unpacking what went wrong is really hard right and the junior Personnel brings the answer to the uh his or her um project leader and says the answer is 35 and the project leader says it cannot be because the range of answers needs to be in 5 to 10 now they both need to debug and figure out what happened and now they're both spending extra time to refresh and go back to scratch right and so uh if you give it um it's extremely powerful for specific tasks if you use it in the wrong context it can actually drag the productivity down so knowing for which problems so the lesson learned for us was let's be super clear for which product for for which specific questions do we want to use it always and then what are the sanity check measures we want to put in place to make sure that the quality and accuracy is right right and then what are the problem statements that we don't want to use it for or we want to teach people how to Chunk Up the questions in the right way to get to the right answers so I'll pause I don't know if this resonates yeah no completely and I this triggered another question my head so you you were talking about making sure you have those review steps in the process to make sure that there is validation of the results because we all know that these large language models sometimes hallucinate and sometimes don't deliver the right answers so what sort of guard rails have you in place in the organization to make sure you you identify those for example if someone is doing a piece of market research is using that your GPT to do that um how do you then make sure that those are accurate yeah so there a few things um there are the the human ones right where we make sure that the right experts are part of the loop right in reviewing the materials so let's what's an interesting example um we've uh let's say you take a you take a company right and you say hey can you give me a projection of like uh if they put the following measures in in place what could be the likely growth rate in the next quarter and if you look historically the the for the last 100 quarters right if if the the average growth rate was I don't know 3 to 5% but there are 10 quarters where the growth rate was 20 30 40% because there was an anomaly of an acquisition or something uh when you now ask GP or gener AI to predict what is the likely next quarter um growth it will 90% of the time tell you 3 to 5% because that's the data set but 10% of the time it's likely going to tell you it's 30 40 50 and if it's to share that result with the team team would say it's hallucinating it's wrong it cannot be true but no it is coming from the data set and 10% of the time when you click refresh it's going to give you something that seems like a hallucination so how do you deal with that we deal with it in two ways one is put an expert that can look at it and if it suggests something like that we say okay that's an anomaly let's jointly look at the historical data let's refresh and ask it three four more times to see what is likely the right answer and then it's going to start giving you the right ranges so that's more human intervention human in the loop that is using it as a thought partner versus automating the workflow so that's one two uh we do not let it be fully autonomous and fully automated workflow again we have to make sure there is human in um the third one is as we learned some of these things there are not technical ways where you can fine-tune the model and put the constraints that if it is um before it starts sharing some of the numbers Etc you can constrain either the data ranges or you can constrain the outliers and you can start putting that as constraints into the model now for that you need usage right you need a number of times to identify that outlier so we can fine-tune it right and put it back into the model so there are some ways that we can fine- tune each of those individual gpts to do this the right way yeah and then the last one I would say also is um each of the software vendors that are putting these tools out there they're learning all this right and they're putting in um constraints into their models and Sanity checks right that where you are you can you can dial in specific weights right in the models Etc as they are getting feedback from the users and what we're seeing from them what's coming is starting to be much more accurate and with with fewer hallucinations right so those are that it's a bundle of all of those things I would say this is an easier conversation a year from now because I do believe that a lot of the models that will be provided as parts of co-pilots Etc we'll have a lot of this already embedded in them as they have it now we're in the moment in between where we need to do a number of interventions ourselves very good so what's the process that BCG go through to decide where to apply AI so is this do you have a a governance system in place and certain review panels that make sure that any AI implement mentation is actually the the most important one aligned to your strategy or do you take an approach where you say actually let's give everyone access to AI let's give everyone access to to experimenting with it um and then people decide by themselves how to use it so I'd love to understand is there a strategic process you go through in some governance or do you make just generic tools available to everyone and and are happy for them to use them as they see fit yeah so it's both um uh with uh and what we've learned through time also by supporting a number of clients right is there will be interesting new applications that of of the AI that you cannot derive top down right but someone in the field will and then we need to make quickly we have to have ability to quickly then swarm those and help them scale it up right to the others uh but at the same time if you just wait for everything round up there might be some big important um workflows that could benefit from it but they require top down Focus so um short ansers we've done both and then specifically um on the piece around the workflows we want to focus on we've um appointed one of our most senior um Partners to run a task force uh where we've identified and we've we've had the task force focus on on two groups one is internal support functions right so HR Finance reporting um it Etc and derive what are the biggest unlocks or frictions or use cases that AI can help um turbocharge or do in a different way and then in parallel we've done the same exercise by looking at all of our different Consulting cohorts and looking at their typical workflows and then identifying where they're spending the most time and then figuring out how can we deploy AI so in the latter one um like we got down to okay um typical consultant spends 50% of his or her time writing slides and then 30% of the time um doing research um online and then you know 10% of the time writing emails and then 10% of the time in meetings if I go to most senior people it's actually the inverse right they spend almost no time writing slides they spend very they spend some time writing emails but they spend 60 70% of the time in the meetings right and so pretty much for every Cort then you go to Engineers Etc we chunked up their daily hours right and um we saw where the time is being spent and where they have frictions and then what we did was we looked at what are the tools available for any one of those steps so there's got to be tools for writing slides in a better way if you write few prompts so we found some we also said they're not having the right protections that we need so we said we're going to build a version of our own which we did we call it Dexter which now with few prompts you get a first draft of a slide Within seconds which sometimes it could have taken you hours to get to that so we've identified where the frictions or bottom legs are to eliminate them that's one two we've also looked at where we could get to the differentiated point of view so let's say you have um experts in biofarm R&D that have their body of knowledge and are pulling in on it we said boy there could be intra you know cross disciplinary insights if we could embed into those workflows data sets from elsewhere so we identified few of those workflows where we created some tools that allow them to access data they usually wouldn't right to derive a better Insight so that's on the Consulting side and then on the internal side we looked at functions like uh you know on the HR side if most of the requests coming in around the benefits like does my insurance cover this or that and we have um folks that need to wait to get that answer we can do a lot of that with ch GPT right or one of the gpts that allow you to interact quicker to get to the information and all of this in the spirit we are high growth company so the only way we can keep growing right in a sustainable way is if we start putting these um these tools um uh to to to help us we call it eliminate um uh eliminate toil and increase Joy uh so that we can focus on things that matter so hopefully these examples made sense and team is still there they meet regularly on a weekly basis we report out to the to the executive committee uh once once every every two months on the progress so it's all the way through to the CEO um on a regular basis so how do you envisage Ai and in particular generative AI changing the future of the Consulting industry um how do you see this evolving over the next 10 years oh it's so hard like a year ago we would not even have this conversation right so it's hard for me to tell you for 10 years how it's going to be out there right um I do think it's going to change how we do things I think it's going to and I know that's super high level I do think that uh probably 50% of the things we're doing today right as a task we're not going to have to do as a task right that will be done through our clever set of prompts Etc I I do think that um it will evolve us more in to the change management um uh set of conversations for example um it's not going to happen just to us right it's going to happen to our clients as well and we've built a wonderful tool for our client's sales organization and they were using it but they were not acting on what was coming out of it right and then we sat down with them and asked why not and they said well my quarterly quota is based on a totally different set of uh actions so this is helpful but I'm still going to do what I'm paid to do and we said great we're going to change your quotas or like work with your leadership to change your quotas I said that's great but not this quarter because I still have the numbers I got to hit so great well let's talk about next quarter then we talk with the leadership and they said fully agree we should do that but not this year we should do next year because my bonus is based on this year's numbers you can do it mid Midway so how do Drive change an adoption of something that you know is the right answer it's truly taking performance to the next level but the internal setup is not there or we have an examp example with a client where we took one process from 10 days to 2 minutes 10 days to two minutes um but the outcome is still 10 days and why well because the team that reviews that meets only once every 10 days and so the only way you change it is they now need to meet daily but they cannot so there's going to be a lot of like focus of the Consultants will move into driving the change in the workflows and figuring out clever ways how to rewire how we do things so that's how I see it evolving in the in the coming years very good so what pieces of advice would you give any CEO listening in here thinking I would like to do what BCG has done successfully in terms of applying AI across um their own organization how do they go about it what are some of the mistakes they need to watch out for yeah I would say learning a few things don't don't shy away from it and don't wait right and activate the the organization um what I see too many of them do is either well let's see how this all plays out and then I'll just pick a tool um issue with that is even if you wait and there is a tool that hallucinates less and it's more relevant Etc you still have the ethical questions you still have the questions on do we have the right data what's the governance process for all of this all of that takes six to 12 months so you can wait for the tool you will still need to do that part so the sooner you start it starts helping you deal with friction for example the the team asked me to build a digital version of me a digital Avatar um and like I said sure let's do it not because I want to have that but because I knew it's going to prompt bunch of questions with legal team with compliance team with risk team so I just put by saying yes a set of workflows in motion that now over three weeks I have a contract that says how my digital identity is protected um I have a team that knows how to review this a legal team knows how to deal with these questions um but that took a few weeks to get to it but now if any of my peers wants to do it it's like Snap and we can move right so the longer you punt a lot of these things you you're not eliminating that work so get started to start figuring out those frictions and what you need to put in terms of the operating model and then two um engage the organization right uh do not Outsource all of this right ourselves and others can help you get moving so when you're looking at a a third party to help you find find someone who wants to help you build capability internally because you need to rewire the business right it's part of DNA now it's not a one-time project so don't think about just Outsourcing it and hoping this goes away or that you're just going to buy a license and you're done right but find partners that can help you be player coaches to teach you give you the drum beat get you moving and then help you build the capability along the way so those would be few thoughts very good piece of advice thank you so much vad I I could carry on talking to you for hours this is super fascinating um I will have another conversation with BCG about another project more specifically um which I'm looking forward to for anyone who ever wants to rewatch this conversation or many other similar conversations on the future of Business and Technology simply head to my YouTube channel so thank you very much Vlad thank you Bernard it was nice to meet you and looking forward to continuing these conversations likewise okay hello everyone and welcome back to my video podcast on the future of Business and Technology and today I want to dive into a use case of how Global consulting firm BCG is using AI internally um and to help me do this I have with me Vlad lukage who is the managing director and Senior partner Global leader Tech and digital advantage and also co-lead bcg's AI at scale offering globally welcome Vlad nice to see you thanks for having me yeah so where are you joining us from today I'm in New York on the

quality is pretty high um the new hires uh the ramp up to the productivity of experienced Consultants was dramatic that their productivity was boosted 30 40% so it worked really well and for the experienced folks that are uh that have been doing the job their productivity went up by 20 30% because they're already pretty fast but this boosted them to be even faster um in in what they were doing so we've seen for sure uh specific Improvement in the productivity and then we've seen the inverse on really complex tasks so if we asked to do some calculations right or if we asked the gener AI uh tools to um to do mathematical ex you know math right or to derve An Answer u in a in a complex question we saw that productivity of the junior folks went down 340% they were less productive and some of the more experienced folks productivity was either flat or went slightly down and the reason was in the complex tasks when a junior person asked like the example that I gave you the line number of lines of code right here if it has to do I don't know give me the market size of something in a specific country based on the data over the last four years um and if the number comes wrong unpacking why it's wrong and unpacking what went wrong is really hard right and the junior Personnel brings the answer to the uh his or her um project leader and says the answer is 35 and the project leader says it cannot be because the range of answers needs to be in 5 to 10 now they both need to debug and figure out what happened and now they're both spending extra time to refresh and go back to scratch right and so uh if you give it um it's extremely powerful for specific tasks if you use it in the wrong context it can actually drag the productivity down so knowing for which problems so the lesson learned for us was let's be super clear for which product for for which specific questions do we want to use it always and then what are the sanity check measures we want to put in place to make sure that the quality and accuracy is right right and then what are the problem statements that we don't want to use it for or we want to teach people how to Chunk Up the questions in the right way to get to the right answers so I'll pause I don't know if this resonates yeah no completely and I this triggered another question my head so you you were talking about making sure you have those review steps in the process to make sure that there is validation of the results because we all know that these large language models sometimes hallucinate and sometimes don't deliver the right answers so what sort of guard rails have you in place in the organization to make sure you you identify those for example if someone is doing a piece of market research is using that your GPT to do that um how do you then make sure that those are accurate yeah so there a few things um there are the the human ones right where we make sure that the right experts are part of the loop right in reviewing the materials so let's what's an interesting example um we've uh let's say you take a you take a company right and you say hey can you give me a projection of like uh if they put the following measures in in place what could be the likely growth rate in the next quarter and if you look historically the the for the last 100 quarters right if if the the average growth rate was I don't know 3 to 5% but there are 10 quarters where the growth rate was 20 30 40% because there was an anomaly of an acquisition or something uh when you now ask GP or gener AI to predict what is the likely next quarter um growth it will 90% of the time tell you 3 to 5% because that's the data set but 10% of the time it's likely going to tell you it's 30 40 50 and if it's to share that result with the team team would say it's hallucinating it's wrong it cannot be true but no it is coming from the data set and 10% of the time when you click refresh it's going to give you something that seems like a hallucination so how do you deal with that we deal with it in two ways one is put an expert that can look at it and if it suggests something like that we say okay that's an anomaly let's jointly look at the historical data let's refresh and ask it three four more times to see what is likely the right answer and then it's going to start giving you the right ranges so that's more human intervention human in the loop that is using it as a thought partner versus automating the workflow so that's one two uh we do not let it be fully autonomous and fully automated workflow again we have to make sure there is human in um the third one is as we learned some of these things there are not technical ways where you can fine-tune the model and put the constraints that if it is um before it starts sharing some of the numbers Etc you can constrain either the data ranges or you can constrain the outliers and you can start putting that as constraints into the model now for that you need usage right you need a number of times to identify that outlier so we can fine-tune it right and put it back into the model so there are some ways that we can fine- tune each of those individual gpts to do this the right way yeah and then the last one I would say also is um each of the software vendors that are putting these tools out there they're learning all this right and they're putting in um constraints into their models and Sanity checks right that where you are you can you can dial in specific weights right in the models Etc as they are getting feedback from the users and what we're seeing from them what's coming is starting to be much more accurate and with with fewer hallucinations right so those are that it's a bundle of all of those things I would say this is an easier conversation a year from now because I do believe that a lot of the models that will be provided as parts of co-pilots Etc we'll have a lot of this already embedded in them as they have it now we're in the moment in between where we need to do a number of interventions ourselves very good so what's the process that BCG go through to decide where to apply AI so is this do you have a a governance system in place and certain review panels that make sure that any AI implement mentation is actually the the most important one aligned to your strategy or do you take an approach where you say actually let's give everyone access to AI let's give everyone access to to experimenting with it um and then people decide by themselves how to use it so I'd love to understand is there a strategic process you go through in some governance or do you make just generic tools available to everyone and and are happy for them to use them as they see fit yeah so it's both um uh with uh and what we've learned through time also by supporting a number of clients right is there will be interesting new applications that of of the AI that you cannot derive top down right but someone in the field will and then we need to make quickly we have to have ability to quickly then swarm those and help them scale it up right to the others uh but at the same time if you just wait for everything round up there might be some big important um workflows that could benefit from it but they require top down Focus so um short ansers we've done both and then specifically um on the piece around the workflows we want to focus on we've um appointed one of our most senior um Partners to run a task force uh where we've identified and we've we've had the task force focus on on two groups one is internal support functions right so HR Finance reporting um it Etc and derive what are the biggest unlocks or frictions or use cases that AI can help um turbocharge or do in a different way and then in parallel we've done the same exercise by looking at all of our different Consulting cohorts and looking at their typical workflows and then identifying where they're spending the most time and then figuring out how can we deploy AI so in the latter one um like we got down to okay um typical consultant spends 50% of his or her time writing slides and then 30% of the time um doing research um online and then you know 10% of the time writing emails and then 10% of the time in meetings if I go to most senior people it's actually the inverse right they spend almost no time writing slides they spend very they spend some time writing emails but they spend 60 70% of the time in the meetings right and so pretty much for every Cort then you go to Engineers Etc we chunked up their daily hours right and um we saw where the time is being spent and where they have frictions and then what we did was we looked at what are the tools available for any one of those steps so there's got to be tools for writing slides in a better way if you write few prompts so we found some we also said they're not having the right protections that we need so we said we're going to build a version of our own which we did we call it Dexter which now with few prompts you get a first draft of a slide Within seconds which sometimes it could have taken you hours to get to that so we've identified where the frictions or bottom legs are to eliminate them that's one two we've also looked at where we could get to the differentiated point of view so let's say you have um experts in biofarm R&D that have their body of knowledge and are pulling in on it we said boy there could be intra you know cross disciplinary insights if we could embed into those workflows data sets from elsewhere so we identified few of those workflows where we created some tools that allow them to access data they usually wouldn't right to derive a better Insight so that's on the Consulting side and then on the internal side we looked at functions like uh you know on the HR side if most of the requests coming in around the benefits like does my insurance cover this or that and we have um folks that need to wait to get that answer we can do a lot of that with ch GPT right or one of the gpts that allow you to interact quicker to get to the information and all of this in the spirit we are high growth company so the only way we can keep growing right in a sustainable way is if we start putting these um these tools um uh to to to help us we call it eliminate um uh eliminate toil and increase Joy uh so that we can focus on things that matter so hopefully these examples made sense and team is still there they meet regularly on a weekly basis we report out to the to the executive committee uh once once every every two months on the progress so it's all the way through to the CEO um on a regular basis so how do you envisage Ai and in particular generative AI changing the future of the Consulting industry um how do you see this evolving over the next 10 years oh it's so hard like a year ago we would not even have this conversation right so it's hard for me to tell you for 10 years how it's going to be out there right um I do think it's going to change how we do things I think it's going to and I know that's super high level I do think that uh probably 50% of the things we're doing today right as a task we're not going to have to do as a task right that will be done through our clever set of prompts Etc I I do think that um it will evolve us more in to the change management um uh set of conversations for example um it's not going to happen just to us right it's going to happen to our clients as well and we've built a wonderful tool for our client's sales organization and they were using it but they were not acting on what was coming out of it right and then we sat down with them and asked why not and they said well my quarterly quota is based on a totally different set of uh actions so this is helpful but I'm still going to do what I'm paid to do and we said great we're going to change your quotas or like work with your leadership to change your quotas I said that's great but not this quarter because I still have the numbers I got to hit so great well let's talk about next quarter then we talk with the leadership and they said fully agree we should do that but not this year we should do next year because my bonus is based on this year's numbers you can do it mid Midway so how do Drive change an adoption of something that you know is the right answer it's truly taking performance to the next level but the internal setup is not there or we have an examp example with a client where we took one process from 10 days to 2 minutes 10 days to two minutes um but the outcome is still 10 days and why well because the team that reviews that meets only once every 10 days and so the only way you change it is they now need to meet daily but they cannot so there's going to be a lot of like focus of the Consultants will move into driving the change in the workflows and figuring out clever ways how to rewire how we do things so that's how I see it evolving in the in the coming years very good so what pieces of advice would you give any CEO listening in here thinking I would like to do what BCG has done successfully in terms of applying AI across um their own organization how do they go about it what are some of the mistakes they need to watch out for yeah I would say learning a few things don't don't shy away from it and don't wait right and activate the the organization um what I see too many of them do is either well let's see how this all plays out and then I'll just pick a tool um issue with that is even if you wait and there is a tool that hallucinates less and it's more relevant Etc you still have the ethical questions you still have the questions on do we have the right data what's the governance process for all of this all of that takes six to 12 months so you can wait for the tool you will still need to do that part so the sooner you start it starts helping you deal with friction for example the the team asked me to build a digital version of me a digital Avatar um and like I said sure let's do it not because I want to have that but because I knew it's going to prompt bunch of questions with legal team with compliance team with risk team so I just put by saying yes a set of workflows in motion that now over three weeks I have a contract that says how my digital identity is protected um I have a team that knows how to review this a legal team knows how to deal with these questions um but that took a few weeks to get to it but now if any of my peers wants to do it it's like Snap and we can move right so the longer you punt a lot of these things you you're not eliminating that work so get started to start figuring out those frictions and what you need to put in terms of the operating model and then two um engage the organization right uh do not Outsource all of this right ourselves and others can help you get moving so when you're looking at a a third party to help you find find someone who wants to help you build capability internally because you need to rewire the business right it's part of DNA now it's not a one-time project so don't think about just Outsourcing it and hoping this goes away or that you're just going to buy a license and you're done right but find partners that can help you be player coaches to teach you give you the drum beat get you moving and then help you build the capability along the way so those would be few thoughts very good piece of advice thank you so much vad I I could carry on talking to you for hours this is super fascinating um I will have another conversation with BCG about another project more specifically um which I'm looking forward to for anyone who ever wants to rewatch this conversation or many other similar conversations on the future of Business and Technology simply head to my YouTube channel so thank you very much Vlad thank you Bernard it was nice to meet you and looking forward to continuing these conversations likewise",
