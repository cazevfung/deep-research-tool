  "content": "thank you I want a pom pom life do you well you guessed it right pom pom are those fluffy fibrous decorative balls which cheerleaders use and when do they use it when you have performed well but the pom pom that I'm talking about has a full form and the smartphones that you hold in your hand the search engines do not have the answer I bet talking about smartphones we also use an app for our travel do we and when we open that app for traveling by Road rail air or a sea and maybe in a few years from now to space if Elon Musk has his way it's smart enough to find out the coordinates of where you are but there's one question it asks and I'm sure that question is going to be there even if we decide to travel to space after about 10 years and that is where to or where do we want to go YOLO that's that's what we hear you only live once and perhaps career path is one of the journeys that we take to get the purpose of our lives and in this career path there are lot of Crossroads that we come across and in each of these Crossroads we have to take a lot of choices and we constantly hear are you choosing your career by chance or by choice there seems to be an issue in as far as the a decision which is taken whether it is excellent whether it has an effective decision and the question is the way we have come across taking decisions for so long will it hold on True To The Future it has consequences Sikkim is a beautiful landlocked Himalayan state every year approximately 4,000 students come out and they have to take career decisions to become employable the government about 10 years ago realized that the state itself would have a challenge in as far as providing so many jobs to them they did an informed career decision for every student passing out from class 10 and identified those profiles which matched with the jobs which the state could offer and for the remaining students they finance them to go to other states so that they could get skilled and get proper jobs which were suitable for them and these students students would pay back the government so that the next batch of students could continue doing this today Sikkim has a department for capacity building which does this but when it comes to individual students decisions well we seem to be undergoing a lot of dilemma because we are spoiled for choices and I I myself was looking at the number of decisions and chances that I was taking and till I came to what became my choice career of helping individuals take informed career decisions and I actually took 11 chances 11 chances before I came to a decision of my choice career do you think it is very efficient do we need to take more efficient decisions well when we look at students around today it reminds me of Alice when she slipped into the magic tunnel and met the Chesire Cat at the crossroads and they had a conversation which went somewhat like this could you tell me please which way I should go asked Alice that depends a good deal on where you want to go said the cat I don't much care where said Alice oh then it does not matter which Road would you take said the cat as long as I get somewhere added Alice in explanation oh you're sure to do that said the cat if only you could go long enough decisions have consequences and such decisions will lead to various consequences but why do we choose a career why at all do we need a career what is it that we are expecting out of a career and when we look at it deeply what are we looking for satisfaction a job which will like doing a job which uses our ability where we can perform well and we will be rewarded well and these are perhaps the critical areas that we're looking at at the end of the career or in the career we are looking for being able to do a job which we like a job which you're capable of doing and a job which is going to reward as well but the way we are taking career decisions this is what is perhaps happening friends he is a farmer he doesn't belong to a family of farmers his parents are not Farmers by the way he's not an agriculture graduate either but he is 2 years older than me on the tedex platform and half my age on the other hand he is an agricultural graduate by chance and by choice to earn his livelihood to take care of his family he's a photographer musician and a Content writer is that something which is ringing a bell in each one of us are we facing these kind of things around us do we know of a doctor who has become a musician do we know of an engineer who has become a cricketer India alone needs 50% more doctors and maybe many more teachers wish the allotted seat goes to a person who's not only deserving but is also passionate about the career of choice please understand this these are two individual students who took a decision informed career decision in class 8 and today they add to the community of one Noble profession which is becoming teachers very importantly what I would like to share with you that when we come to these various Crossroads what are these Crossroads when we are in class 10 we have to take a choice of streams when we are in class 12 we have to take a decision about which are the professional courses we need to join and after that a number of Crossroads we come in and there are a huge number of choices and these choices which we have we have to identify those which are relevant for us but when we are taking those choices we seem to be influenced and because we are influenced the influencers are actually stopping us from seeing many of the choices which may have been more relevant for us from conventional non-conventional and even New Age career programs the first person who influences is our parents they have their set of choices which exactly are necessary and they decide that yes these are the career options which are relevant for them and which will make their child happy successful and earning their livelihood then come friends friends want to be in the comfort zone of more friends so either they decide the careers that they have thought of and they want us to also join the same program or we do the same influencing on them and then comes the market the market is looking out for more and more students to join their seats you know as far as the institutes are concerned and the industry is constantly talking about trends because they want the right person to be joining the right job and academics well they are necessary but not sufficient and given the right environment your ability and punch I say that because when I was in sales for a while one of the chances that I took I got the right environment and my ability and my punch both came out so technically I keep telling that if you are in the right environment you will have everything come out coming out properly so you must nurture them in the right places and these are the influences which work this girl had been influenced to become a doctor or an administrative officer the informed career decision luckily we could counsel her parents and these are the designer macarons which she makes today and they sell in the Middle East so friends there is a solution and today there are assessment tools which will identify what our interests are what our aptitude is and what is our personality traits because we need to know what are our likes and dislikes we need to know what we can capably do well and we need to know what our personality is so that we know which kind of environment we are more comfortable with and these are very standardized tools and once we have identified what is our interest aptitude and personality we need a guide because today there are more than 4,500 career options it's a maze over there and that is a proper guide who can identify with these skill sets which are those career options which are more appropriate for you and once you know the skill sets which are required to do the job well you have to just identify the courses which will help you develop the skills and once youve identified the skills you just need to go to the institutes which offer these programs find out their eligibility criteria and start preparing for this and you're ready to hit the career path path this will ensure that you are taking the right choice at the right time and the earlier you do it it is better because you have brought in a decision process which is very very efficient because it reduces the number of chances that you're taking in life and it ensures that you are the right person for the right job what else can be have happening just consider the hard earned money that either our parents or if we are self- financing our program we are putting into education if we realize that if we are taking career CH Decisions by chance this money becomes an expenditure but if we are taking a career decision by choice it becomes an investment and the time spent in that career preparation becomes a good return on the time invested I call it R oi or Roy the institutes get the right student to the right classroom and can you imagine what will happen to the teachers will they start enduring you or will they start enjoying making you learn what you have come there to learn I'm sure when I was a student I had a number of challenges in as far as teachers in some subjects I used to go to sleep in the back bench I'm sure we all did that right and another important part is the right job goes to the right company a right individual therefore the industry which is constantly looking for employable people the right person gets the right job and there is organic growth because of this and Friends he is a person who took his decision in class 8 just to share with you and he had a new age career decision which was taken for him and he did not have to take any special sessions and he finished his ma uh engineering degree from one of the leading technical colleges of the country he did his Masters abroad and today he is an application scientist working in the largest e-commerce portal in the world these are two who took were Bankers till their mid-30s and took an informed career decision to leave their job and start their own Venture one thing we have to remember there will be a race but it will not be a rat race we will have to perform there will be stress but this will be positive stress and he is a person who won the national award for best dress designer in 2018 for films in India his decision was taken when he was in class 12 he had to self- finance his program and what happened he worked in a laundry pressing clothes and packing them and this is what made him what he is today he is a film dress designer of Fame today we are a nation of 1.25 billion people and we have a literacy rate of approximately 71 some percentage I guess and in a few years from now we are going to become the youngest Workforce in the world I leave you with a choice whether to take your career by chance or you want to take an informed career decision I began with something saying that pom pom you must be reminded about that also you must be wondering what is that full form that J Shanker is talking about well we created it when we started career guidance for students it stands for peace of mind and plenty of money if you decide to choose a career because it has plenty of money peace of mind may or may not follow but if you take an informed career decision based on your interest aptitude and personality peace of mind will be there and money will follow thank you",
