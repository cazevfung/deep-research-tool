  "content": "hello everybody welcome to today's video today  we are going to talk through the business model of linkedin i am super excited to have  this discussion and i would love to read what you guys are taking away from this video  as well please write your three key takeaways from the discussion in the comments box and i  would love to read through them let's jump right into the discussion there are three things that i  want to talk through number one why was linkedin acquired by microsoft in 2016 number two what are  the primary revenue streams for linkedin number three what are the challenges and who are its  competitors we'll also finally touch about what are some of the futuristic things that linkedin  can do going forward okay now you might ask me hey what's the big deal about linkedin right let  me throw some facts and figures at you number one the revenues are growing at 25 percent year over  year number two the subscriber count itself is massive there are 750 million plus people on  linkedin today all right that's a huge number if you combine these two things it's  super powerful let me also tell you one other interesting thing right there is no other  social media platform at this scale which is able to get revenues from the users of the platform  itself right linkedin is the only platform where users are ready to pay for its services you use  social media platforms such as facebook instagram right snapchat twitter none of these platforms  are able to charge the customers but linkedin users are happy to pay the premium subscription  services to linkedin right so that's a very unique feature about linkedin itself okay so let's  jump right away into our first part that is hey why microsoft acquired linkedin in the first  place if you take a look at microsoft products right the first one is office dynamics  the second one is office 365 the third one is the entire suit of like hey outlook  excel powerpoint a bunch of other things too what does it tell you microsoft is leading in the  professional work tool space right if you add to that the professional profile of every individual  it's a powerful combination for example if you are working on a blockchain project and if you are  typing your emails in outlook hey i'm having this particular problem in the blockchain space can  you help me to your colleague if microsoft can intelligently integrate the outlook and linkedin  platforms which by the way it is already doing right you get all your linkedin posts feed the  proposed courses everything around blockchain right that is super powerful and it is also  beneficial for the customer like you and i right if you think about another use case right  hey you are using excel but you are struggling you are using powerpoint but you are struggling  probably there is a pop-up on linkedin saying that hey this is a course on linkedin that you can  recommend so the opportunities for integration are pretty high and that is one of the primary reasons  why microsoft has brought linkedin and also as you can see this entire social network that  linkedin has created among the professionals is one of its kind so microsoft without any  previous entry into the social media space has got the entire social network where it is  already having a stronghold so it is a match made in heaven right now why is it important for you if  you are refresher if you are a young professional just joining workforce right people might start  looking at your linkedin profile through your outlook emails itself so it is very important for  you to actually maintain a good linkedin profile the sooner you start the better it is  you can express your views on certain academic issues certain like industry areas on  linkedin and that could easily reflect into your professional life too so you maintaining an active  linkedin network and an active linkedin profile is not only beneficial for you going forward in your  job search but it actively plays an important role in your current work environment as well okay so  please don't get into some kind of nasty comments or any of that negative stuff on linkedin it is  going to unnecessarily create a bad impression about you in the workplace so that's about the  integration of microsoft with linkedin now if we move into what are some of the revenue streams  for linkedin itself so let us start with the most obvious one that is subscriptions right  you and i are happy to pay for linkedin for premium subscription at least there are numbers  that are floating around which says that hey 39 of the linkedin subscribers are premium members  well i don't know if that is such a high number but still it indicates to us that hey folks are  willing to pay for this kind of premium service number two it is marketing these days i am  getting a lot of upgrade ads on my linkedin feed you might be getting too right you might  be getting from all kinds of edutech firms this indicates that hey if there is a place for  an organization to target to bring awareness about its product it is linkedin and more so if  it is a higher end product which is targeting professionals which is targeting students  because there are close to 750 plus million of us on linkedin right so that is number two which is  linkedin marketing solutions the third thing that i want to talk about is of course the hiring  right linkedin jobs linkedin actually started its revenue streams through linkedin hiring  itself right it was not a traditional job portal but folks could always find jobs on linkedin  an interesting tidbit over here is that hey folks did not create their linkedin profiles with  the objective that they'll get a job immediately but they created their linkedin profiles with  the objective that hey they want to improve their personal brand itself and that is what attracted  employers towards the platform itself right so that's a super strong revenue stream for linkedin  unfortunately the revenue breakdown between these individual streams is not shared after microsoft  has acquired linkedin but ultimately this has been the first bread and butter revenue stream for  linkedin okay moving on to the fourth one that is linkedin learning right hey you hire somebody from  linkedin you are able to create awareness about a product on linkedin and finally you want to  actually train your employees through linkedin as well and what's the best place you hire somebody  immediately you send them three to four linkedin courses and say you get started or linkedin can  rather do a better job right it can say that hey your new hire is already proficient in excel and  microsoft powerpoint but probably they need some kind of training in sql so why don't you help them  with these three or four courses right so that is the power of the platform where it already knows  what you know and it is telling you what are the gaps that you need to fill from your career point  of view right that's number four that is linkedin learning number five is linkedin sales okay you  get these kind of ads right hey from udemy from an academy telling you please read through about  our particular course now if the same organization is looking forward to interact with a company  right let's say an academy or udemy or upgrad is trying to sell its courses to a large organization  where 500 people can be trained on data science right it can easily do that through contacting the  head of training in that particular company right and that is possible through linkedin and you can  actually use a personalized message or you can use few of the linkedin tools that are available which  can help you target directly the decision makers in these companies so just summarize these are the  five revenue streams number one your subscriptions number two linkedin marketing number three  hiring number four your learning and number five sales okay so now let us move on into what are the  competitors and what are some of the challenges that linkedin is facing in this particular field  okay it is interesting to notice that linkedin is not necessarily competing with just one single  player if you take for example learning aspect right linkedin is competing with udemy's courseras  and a bunch of other e-learning platforms if you compare on the other end the hiring needs  right it is competing with indeed nokri monster and a lot of other these job typical job portals  the third thing right social media time it is competing with instagram facebook youtube so on  and so forth so the competitors for linkedin are pretty dangerous they are coming from all walks  of life another important aspect is that linden is still small in each one of these individual  revenue streams for example linkedin marketing revenues are up to three billion dollars  and if you compare it with google facebook or any other social media platforms marketing  revenues it is super small yes of course it is playing in a niche targeting only professionals  but still the scope is super high for them to grow if you look at the number of job portals right  indeed is posting almost 25 million jobs every single month and linkedin on the other hand  is posting up to two to three million jobs this difference is massive and there is also  a lot of growth in each one of these areas because the platform itself is super small to  start off with so whereas the competitors are big fishes in each one of these independent areas  linkedin is positioned uniquely so that they can still grow in every single area it can grow in  marketing it can grow in their hiring needs it can still grow and engage subscribers more in the  platform compared to a facebook or a youtube or an instagram right so different things are possible  what is in it for you your professional profile may stay here and a lot of people might  be looking at this particular profile to evaluate your capabilities to evaluate your  emotional strengths your analytical strengths in the coming decades so please be super careful  in how you actually build your profile it is not going to be a a one month two month game right  you try today if it doesn't work you leave it no this has to be a consistent effort because  the growth path for london is super clear so folks are going to use it and you need to have  a very strong base on this particular platform microsoft indeed mentioned that hey for all its  professional tools it is looking forward to make linkedin profile as one single point of contact  so that is going to be huge so please focus and also make sure that you are building your profile  in the best way possible of course the platform is already at a good place so what can linkedin do  going forward one one of the easiest use cases that i could think about is smart contracts  right it could say to the employers that hey once you have three conversations and the three  conversations that happen on the linkedin platform are successful will immediately have an offer  letter rolled out through a smart contract system right that is super powerful linkedin can also  say that hey we are opening up linkedin for kids right probably for 10 standard 12 standard  students it could be around academics it could be around learning it could be around a exposure  to different topics they can completely completely customize these things number three of course  there is china for linkedin right in the recent past less than three to four months back linkedin  has mentioned that they are moving out of china for its social networking and feed aspects of the  business and it is only going to have a specific jobs portal right so it would be very interesting  to see how that would pan out moving forward there are technology updates that are possible for  example there is already apply with linkedin button right they could come up with more such  kind of features which will make it easier for both the applicant and also for the organization  right so a lot of these things are in the mix and a lot of these things will make two things  one life easier for the employers organizations and also it will increase the engagement of the  user itself so to summarize after a few years you might not even have a choice with respect to  using versus not using your linkedin profile your employer might say that hey the base underlying  profiles we pulled that information from linkedin so you need to have it if you have some prior  profile it will only help folks to get a little more understanding about you right so please don't  ignore that aspect number two there are a lot of revenue streams for linkedin at this point in time  please do mention all the five revenue streams in the comments box okay and these revenue streams  are still small compared to the competitors in each one of these spaces so the road forward is  only looking brighter for linkedin number three the technology advancements will increase the  engagement for both the employers and also for the subscribers like you and me so to conclude i'm  expecting all of you to start writing on linkedin all right and i'm looking forward to more and more  interactions through linkedin as well with each one of you thank you so much guys if you like this  video if you want me to do a few more analysis of this particular slot let me know and i will  continue to do it for you thanks and take care hello everybody welcome to today's video today\nwe are going to talk through the business model
