  "content": "my name is Hannah and I work as a recruitment consultant I was living in Australia at the time and I actually went to go see a recruiter about him getting me a job and we sat and kind of had a chat about what I liked and what I didn't like and what I was looking for in my next role and he turned round and was like I've got a job for you but it's probably not what you're thinking about why don't you come and work for me and I teach how to be a recruiter so therefore about nine ten months and then my next role was internal recruitment so it's slightly different to agency and that was for g4s so I went and worked for them and recruited front-of-house and security staff into their global accounts so it was companies like Google Facebook snapchat so some really cool brands my natural which was another internal role we looked at not only the roles that we had on at the moment we looked when they when we found that most of the salespeople handed in their notice when there was the highest volume of recruitment and was there a reason for their being that high volume and if so what could we do to kind of prep for that for that time of the year and let's look at the characteristics of the high performers and the low performers and is there a common denominator between those high performers and so how can we I guess create a profile of the perfect person and then look for that in our recruitment in the future and so it was really exciting and that's probably one of my favorite roles because it was not just filling vacancies it was looking at the wider area of recruitment and looking at you know although it was all linked to recruitment it was our our hiring managers doing best practice interview techniques and are we looking at the after care of these people once they'd signed a contract and now we're making sure that they're taking every box to pass their probation and if not what can we do to make sure that they are and how can we kind of get the best out of these new people so that they keep working their way up the career ladder and then my tier visa was up in Australia so I moved time and and I went through a Rexha reckon I moved home so is a recruiter that recruits recruiters I went back into agency and that's the role that I'm in now so that's working in London and it's working I distilled your marketing communications recruitment because that's kind of what I've always done and so I've just followed that pathway the whole way through and I do it in two FMCG companies retail media agency you're working with a huge range of clients you go out and you find those clients based on the specific area the you recruiting so you relationship build with those clients you'll often find that they're working with a lot of other agencies as well so it's a bit of a I guess race against the clock to see who can fill that role at first if you work in in-house you're working for one company specifically and you're doing all their recruitment within that company so you're sort of sitting within the HR team know if it's literally you can start from resourcing roles so resourcing roles you wouldn't necessarily get given specific clients for you to work on you'd be working alongside someone who has roles and you would be phoning the candidates and ask them if they're interesting the roles and kind of finding people for those roles to help someone else out and that's kind of the way you go in you then start as a resource and then you become a recruitment consultant but now you don't need any specific qualifications I think it's more personality that that makes a difference in recruitment I did French German geography drama drama was one definitely I think that helped just purely because of from a confidence point of view I think as I said you know you've got to be prepared to have those conversations with people you've got to kind of be prepared to be thinking on the spot and that sort of things I think that helps in terms of confidence at a level I did English French and Business Studies business I think was definitely one that helped just purely because I think if you understand how a business works and the different areas of a business and how they all work together to make that business moving forward it helps you in terms of your recruitment if you're working internally you've got to understand every area of the business because when I was well although I predominantly recruit in marketing and communications if I was working internally I'd have to recruit the finance roles and the HR roles and that's not necessarily something that I would know about so I think having an understanding of a business as a whole and how it all works together it definitely helps English is always useful I think you know your writing job ads and things like that so for me I don't know if it's because I work in the industry but I hate job ads when you read them and there's typos and things like that just because I think if you can't even write the job properly it makes me not want to apply for it so I think from an English point of view that's always useful and and then my degree with business as well so I did international business so again I guess same as a level a lot of people end up going on and doing further qualification so a lot of people if you go in house end up doing a CIPD or something on that's there are other qualifications you can get and things like that within recruitment but I previously worked as a brand manager company um and that was an FMCG company which is now what I recruit in I also previously worked in an HR role it was part of an internship at uni so I did a year internship where I worked in a role that sat within the HR team so I got a bit more of an understanding about the world of recruitment and how that fitted in and the importance of HR so I think they definitely both helped just because it gave me a clear understanding of day-to-day business life and also I was fortunate enough to fall into a recruitment role recruiting roles that previously worked in so that definitely helped tenacity definitely that's literally the biggest one you're gonna get a lot of no so you've got to be prepared for them have a bit of a thick skin and I think there's a tendency when you first start for it to really affect you when someone's a bit horrible to you on the phone or a bit rude or says no whereas you just need to brush it off and kind of on to the next one have to be confident obviously you know you're putting yourself in situations where you're going out and meeting people that you've never spoken to you before and often you know you're talking about a role that might be a lot higher than a role you've ever recruited for before and so you are a little out of your depth and I guess there is a little bit of that fake it till you make it you talk about it like you know what you're talking about and you have to be prepared to not along and pretend that you understand it all and retain that information to then be able to go away and find the right person for that role and whilst as a recruiter you know that you physically cannot know everything about every role not all clients think like that they presume that if you're recruiting for that road that you know everything and so you do have to have that that kind of confidence to sit there and talk about a subject that you perhaps don't know a whole lot about I think you have to have a bit of a natural sales drive because you know you are pushing people and whilst you have to accept that not everyone's going to take your business there is also that tendency to kind of don't take no for an answer you have to be a people person you know you're around people all the time whether that's your team whether that's your candidates right that's your clients and you know you're working long hours with those people so definitely a people person so recruitment is quite long hours and purely because I guess if you think about when you're talking to a recruiter you can't talk to them during your work days so you can talk to them before work at lunchtime or after work which then kind of means that I need to be available before work and after work and see a day probably is a bit bit skewed and probably not you your regular nine-to-five and but I would go into the office probably about 8:30 so that I can catch people for about half an hour before on a normal day I would I sort of split my day I guess in the morning I talk to a lot of my client so I try and get them on the phone any updates about roles were working on at the moment anything that's changed over nie any business development calls talking to new clients and then in the afternoon I tend to focus on my candidate so that's looking at who's applied for the jobs calling through them all speaking to any candidates that have come through and using LinkedIn to find new candidates and that sort of thing so I guess basic level I tend to split it down the middle and do morning clients afternoon candidates so your writing job ads we're taking job briefs finding out what people need qualification wise background day-to-day responsibilities for roles so that you can create a profile and then find the person to fit that profile it's a lot of time on the phone and you are speaking to kind of I guess widening your network and speaking to other companies even if they're not recruiting it's a lot of meeting people as well so I'm out the office a lot of the time whether it's sitting having a coffee with potential candidates or going up for a dinner with a client or that sort of thing a lot of research of the market so knowing who's got new marketing directors who's looking to I don't know who's been bought by a new company so is likely gonna have a bit of a shift in hierarchy where there might be vacancies or people though redundant and then looking for roles and you know what's going on in the market at the moment whether that's through just that company in general whether that's through government legislation that sort of thing I think the way that you can be kind of the best at recruitment is know in your market a lot of the time you get clients asking you how do you think this will affect it or do you think this is normal for this time of year and if you can speak competently about it they're probably more likely to get on board with what you're saying so I think I spend a lot of time doing research about what's going on in the world there's websites that I sign up to that send bulletins every morning of things that are going on and kind of the five things you need to know this morning so a lot of things like that I go to a lot of seminars and things like that I'm signed up to loads of like talks and that sort of thing but mainly it's just I have a Google Alert and that sort of thing that's just putting it in my inbox anything that's any changes and I try and do that at a time that's not really affecting my work day so I'll do it on the train into work or the train home from work and that sort of thing where I've got time to just sit down and just kind of have a little read about what's going on in the world my favorite thing is the so one of the girls that I recruited must have been about 18 months ago now just got a promotion and she told me about it and then I get this little feeling that I'm gonna be so happy because I've put her in that job and she's now worked really hard and they recognized that and she's got a promotion I think that for me is really satisfying that I've put her in a job that not only she loves that she's clearly succeeding him and I think that's kind of where I get my buzz from knowing that they're gonna really like it and that you know and I see things on LinkedIn and things like that where people have been promoted or they've got a new job and I'm I'm always so happy for them because I feel I've kind of given them that head start I think that for me is the best part about recruitment it's long hours it's definitely the long hours and I think it's a real rollercoaster of a job you can have really really good days and you can have really really bad days where no one's answering the find jobs you've been working really hard on have been filled by another agency and you just kind of you feel like you really you know struggling uphill but then there are days where everything goes really right and you pick up new jobs without even trying everyone's answering the phone and the perfect candidate falls into your lap and that sort of thing so it's a real mixed emotions which is why I think you have to have that hard skin because you have to kind of know yes okay today's we have a bad day but tomorrow we'll start again and we'll try again so I think once you get that mentality into your head that you are going to work in long hours and there are going to be bad days where it seems like everything's fighting against you and I would say they're probably the worst parts about the job I think normally it tends to be where there's vacancies and then you learn that industry I think I was very fortunate in I fell into marketing and comms and that's what I've done before I guess if there's a bay you can see where it does suit your background whether that's through work you've done before or a personal interest then they would always try and put you there I think it's kind of I guess case-by-case basis really the general route is that you go in acts of an entry-level roles and resource and then you work your way up to a consultant you can be a senior consultant you then get to be a team leader where obviously you're managing your team of of people who were doing you're all doing I guess marketing and comms for example but you will do in slightly different areas and that's kind of I guess the easiest way to work your way up a lot of people do that and then go internal purely because they get a bit nicer hours and they've kind of found their niche what they specialize in in the sort of industries that they used to and then go internal and work in a talent acquisition team where they're just working for one company my advice would be to work improvement oh I love it I think it's such a fun job I really like I meet new people every day I've made so many friends through it and I think it's probably a role that you wouldn't necessarily think of doing straightaway I think if you're confident and outgoing and you like meeting new people then give it a go would be my advice you",
