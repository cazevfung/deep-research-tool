The part that got me the most was the throwback to language formats - JSON, XML, etc. The whole idea of prompt engineering was to be able to ask the LLM questions in plain English. If we go back to formats, however intuitive they might be (by the way \"intuitive\" is highly subjective), fewer people would be able to prompt because of the learning curve. Of course, not all people are trying to create agents. It looks like context engineering is for the time being geared towards agentic programming.",

These prompts are generally shorter, focused on immediate interaction, and iteratively refined during the conversation. A context prompt used in an AI agent is more complex and structured. This is part of \"context engineering,\" where you create a detailed, comprehensive prompt that acts like an instruction manual for the agent. It includes multiple components such as task instructions, tools usage, memory access, guardrails, and orchestration. This prompt often involves structured data formats (e.g., XML, JSON) and covers all possible scenarios and actions upfront because the agent operates autonomously to accomplish tasks without iterative back-and-forth interaction.",

Once you have a good representation of your data (by selecting, merging, mapping, etc.), even a light model can surpass a complex models (e.g, Logistic->xgboost). For agents, these features are the context. So, it is not only the goal (pilot using big LLM), it is the system (components besides the LLM). The idea is to develop an agent/workflow/app with the smallest feasible LLM so that you are forced to improve the system (cognitive architecture) first.

Spec-first development enables managing large AI-generated code (00:03:33) 3. Goals: handle complexity, no slop, production code, shared understanding (00:03:58) 4. Naive coding agents fail by endless back-and-forth prompting (00:04:06) 5. Intentional compaction improves context usage and agent memory management (00:04:39) 6. Context window content must be carefully curated for quality (00:05:15) 7. Context engineering is key to agent effectiveness and output quality (00:05:49) 8. Minimizing token use while maximizing useful context improves results (00:06:20) 9. Sub-agents enable context control by delegating targeted codebase queries (00:06:59) 10. Frequent intentional compaction maintains context window under 40% usage (00:08:20) 11. Three-phase workflow: research, plan, implement for effective context management (00:09:00) 12. Mental alignment via code review focuses on shared understanding, not lines (00:10:00) 13. Case study: successful one-shot fix on 300k line Rust codebase (00:10:58) 14. Complex problem solved with 35k lines shipped in 7 hours (00:11:34) 15. Hierarchy of errors: bad research causes more issues than bad code (00:11:57) 16. Reviewing specs over code improves efficiency and correctness (00:12:40) 17.

Where every parent agent has access of more than one worker/child tools. The fact is that any parent agent can wrap a child or worker tool if it's needed but the child cannot wrap as a parent. When the parent gets initiated, it works like a private network which doesn't have access to the main agent memory where it has its separate dedicated memory. Also it can call any other parent agent a tool in the flow of execution. It means the current flow gets held until another called parent tool final output gets received. Another interesting thing is that the called another parent as tool can also create another private network which is fresh and does have access to the running current parent private memory. You can call this setup as multi agents I guess (but not worked in parallel)",

I've broken broken it sooo many times and as a non-coder, I don't know what to do when all the AI fails.

I spent nights jumping between tutorials, blog posts, and endless Reddit threads. At the end, I had a mess of notes and half-baked ideas… but no real clarity. Then I landed on your video. In just 20 minutes, you connected the dots I had been struggling with for weeks. That’s not just information, that’s teaching . The flow, the examples, the links, the way you anticipate the exact questions that pop into my head — it shows how much thought and prep you put into this. Honestly, it reminded me why some creators stand out: you respect both the topic and the audience. What I love most is that your content isn’t just about tech, it’s about opportunity. I’m already brainstorming ways to apply this in my own projects — not to replace human creativity, but to amplify it. And that shift in mindset could literally change how I work (and maybe even open doors I didn’t think were possible). So, massive respect . You didn’t just post a tutorial — you dropped a roadmap that people like me can actually use. Subscribed, liked, and 100% coming back for more. Keep setting the bar high, because you’re not just teaching AI… you’re teaching confidence in a brand-new world of tools. #AIagents #LevelUp #GameChanger",

I like the job and it has helped me push my limits further even though I am unhappy about two things mainly: 1) the lack of transparency on the P&L of my team (to better understand what I cost and what I bring) 2) the high results needed to have a bonus (earnings starting from 60k every 3 months).

I resonate with the speaker saying that they strive to give everyone a fair chance at a job...and also not wanting to miss out on a candidates because the piece of paper doesn't convey them fully. People are HUMAN - we are not automated, systematic robots. and no matter how well one incorporates the STAR method, it may get them in the door, but i guarantee it will have them on their way right back out once they start to work and their true character and personality start to come out.",

I've been working with companies on this exact problem, and here's what I've noticed: when you SHOW your culture instead of just describing it, everything changes. A 2-minute video of your actual team interacting, your real workspace, how decisions get made - that tells candidates more than any \"we're like a family\" job posting ever could. The best part? People who don't fit your culture will self-select out before applying. You get fewer applications, but they're from people who actually WANT to work in your environment. It's like dating - you want someone who's excited about the real you, not some generic version you think they want to see. Have you experimented with video content to showcase culture authentically?

You also have to make sure you have the equipment. Don't have a grater? A juicer? A masher? Go get one or figure out a way using what you do have. Then you need to organize everything. Wet ingredients, dry ingredients what bowl sizes to hold what until you're ready to combine get the pots or cooker out. Then you need to be able to measure. Then you need to follow instructions. There may be some element of timing involved. Marinate for a 8 hours or let soak for one hour, pre-heat the oven 15 minutes before placing roast to cook for one hour per lb. So to be a GOOD cook, it requires certain skills. Time management, organization, ability to follow an instructions.
