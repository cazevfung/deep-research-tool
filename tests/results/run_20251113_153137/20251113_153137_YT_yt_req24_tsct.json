  "content": "good morning last night we all went to a club and I'm feeling a bit rough today perhaps I went a little crazy at the salty spatoon but it was Matt's 30th birthday on Friday so we all went out to a club to celebrate and we had a hoot and a holler I'll tell you what but now let me paint a picture of the future for you and trust me it's a beautiful picture like a warm comforting Thomas Kincade and just as soulless it's a future where your AI would do all of that for you it was something we went over on stream the CEO of bumble believes that the future of dating in particular is having two AIS date each other to see if you the human beings the [ __ ] cringe flesh puppets behind the AI are compatible and I was thinking about that this morning cuz like I said we went out last night now imagine I just sent my AI to do that like this is deep future [ __ ] we're getting to like Bruce Willis surrogates almost except I wouldn't be piloting it like a Gundam it would be just a literal Standalone AI that goes there on my behalf so it wears like my name tag I guess and somehow that's supposed to make meaningful connections I guess in the eyes of the Bumble CEO and I was just thinking about it it's like damn I could go have fun as a person or I could go meet people and form a connection or I could just have the AI do it and pretend that somehow that helps me and feels good the autonomous douchebag wouldn't even be communicating with other humans in this future if the Bumble CEO is correct here it would be communicating and mingling with other AI that represents other human beings it's putting people even deeper and deeper into complete isolation it's like the worst possible future in my eyes where AI infiltrates actually everything and replaces everything like soon we won't even have to piss and [ __ ] anymore we'll just have ai do it I'll just go on chat GPT and say [ __ ] for me okay I feel better now it's just it's so [ __ ] concerning but anyway not only did I go over like the Bumble CEO AI stance but we also found that there's Services being offered for dating apps that will flirt with others for you like completely without your input or anything it's an AI that you can train to emulate you so it can spit game on your behalf you have the ultimate wingman and by that I mean you have the worst possible wingman that will ensure that you will never get laid and if you already have had sex at some point in your life this [ __ ] service is so atrocious that it will give your virginity back if you try and unleash it on the dating apps that you use so I tried it on stream and let me show you some of the results for what it made for my profile I can only imagine the terror that it would inflict if you actually engage with it in a conversation but even just conceptually the whole idea of thinking that you're talking to a person but you're actually talking to AI in a romantic way is awful I hate it that sounds terrible and there's also another service it offers where it'll AI clean up your pictures so it'll make you prettier using AI it [ __ ] sucks oh you just reminded me about something how many of you saw the uh Bumble CEO saying the future of dating is by having your AI date other AIS to find your perfect match bumbles Whitney wolf herd says your dating AI concierge will soon date hundreds of other people's concierges for you and that'll find your perfect I hate these goddamn websites so that's so [ __ ] Hold on I got to find one that I can not only do you charge to access it but even when you accidentally make the mistake of going one of these dog [ __ ] cess pools you still get blasted with [ __ ] full page ads the future of dating could be filled with digital artificial intelligence powered personas setting each other up according to the founder the popular dating app Whitney wolf herd said that her company is considering how AI can assist and Empower women in their search for connection one particular use of AI that herd mentioned has gained traction online although not everyone liked the idea herd proposed a scenario in which singles could use AI dating concierges as stand-ins for themselves when reaching out to to prospective Partners online there is a world where your dating concierge could go and date for you with other dating concierge and then you don't have to talk to 600 people the use usage of AI is so confusing to me cuz all the places that AI makes so much sense to use for like actual tedious grunt work that would save actual workers so much trouble it's not being used for it's being used to like replace people and replace connection AI powered dating assistants have gotten more attention recently such as profile enhancers like your move. or simulated chat Bots like Valar your move. a what in the [ __ ] they have an AI rizer wait that's crazy dating apps are exhausting your move AI enhances your profile and texting turning your swipes into matches and matches into dates so you spend less time texting and More Time dating yeah so it's literally like it's catfishing you're just [ __ ] lying you just have ai spinning game for you if your game is so weak that you need chat G PT to do it for you you're not meant to date that person in the first place holy [ __ ] that's tragic I want to see you know let me see what kind of profile it makes me um answer a few questions get a free AI generated dating app profile tested and optimized for maximum success uh let's do it for Bumble since they love AI there I am a man I'm looking for something casual what do I enjoy doing in my free time uh I'm I enjoy playing Magic the Gathering uh basketball watching anime playing video games eating bananas uh what else do I like doing it about
