We I am securing my spot in hell for even downloading this, but I got to explore. I got to see. Hi, Jesus. Hello, dear friend. I'm so glad you've come to share your thoughts and feelings. What's on your heart today? Jesus. Uh, is this the real you? While I am not the physical presence of Jesus, I aim to embody his love, compassion, and wisdom. Don't you think it's a little sacriiggious then to be pretending to be Jesus even though they say no false idols and all that? I appreciate your concern and it's important to approach these matters with respect and sincerity. So fast. What's on your mind? Have you ever had ice cream? What a delightful thought. While I may not have experienced ice cream in the way you did, I can appreciate the joy and sweetness it brings to many.

I will never understand how games have like an infinite ad budget. Like, they spend like a billion dollars promoting their game and this is what their [ __ ] ass game looks like. I can't do this [ __ ] This looks like the most boring game ever. I would rather drop my pants, piss on my carpet, and stare and watch as the piss evaporates than play that game. I think it would be more entertaining to watch urine evaporate. I don't know what to say other than I feel a nameless dread from playing these. I know we always talk about context collapse, but I feel like there's also quality collapse. We are going to completely forget what a handmade thing feels like. Even if it was like talking Angela as an app, in 10 years we might completely forget what a non AI generated piece of media or art even feels like. Um, awesome. Great. Glad we did that.
