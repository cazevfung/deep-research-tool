Your hope your cast of villains, heroes, and inbetweeners will be fawned over for ages once you finally get published, or that your favorite celebrity will end up playing the role of in the feature film that is destined to come from your work. Characters are pretty important. Whether you’re writing a literary fiction piece that is in the perspective of a fly on the wall, or you’re writing a rushing action novella that focuses on a rogue spy, your character matters. In all of your effort to make them as believable as possible, you might pick their brains a bit, pretend you’re in their situation, or formulate a full-fledged Oprah interview for them to get to know them better.\nThis is where things can get out of hand.\nA major pitfall to ‘getting to know your characters’ is falling into the trap of autonomous characterization. That sounds really fancy and snazzy and all, but it’s about as pertinent to your writing process as your mother-in-law buying you a meat tenderizer after you’ve told her about seventeen times that you’re a vegan and couldn’t possibly have any use for it. In other words,\nYou might say, \"But Teva, I need to know my characters as much as possible!\", and while I entirely understand that, treating them as entities apart from yourself is not actually going to help you know them \"as much as possible\". To that you might say, \"But Teva! HOW ELSE CAN I KNOW EVERYTHING ABOUT THEM?!\"\nLet's look at this logic, shall we.\nIf you walk up to a random stranger, anywhere you see fit to walk up to random strangers, and begin asking them a series of personal questions, assuming that they actually answer you, do you suddenly know more about them than they know about themselves?\nWhat you have learned is something from an outsider’s perspective. You just learned something that anyone else could learn by asking the same person the same questions, assuming they felt like answering honestly, and something that the person being asked still knows more about than you do. If you asked me what my favorite color was, I might say purple. I probably wouldn't explain that I actually only say that because it's one of the few colors I think suits me, even though I really don't have a particularly\nYour autonomous character controls the information, if you let them. By this logic, your character has their own personality, their own brain, their own decision making skills- Which leaves you at their mercy as far as progress and continuation goes.\nCan you see where this is going?\nWhat sense does it make, as a writer, to rely on something\nfor something as crucial as a plot point, character development, or even a solid slope of progress in your actual story? What sense would it make to rely on something\nto tell you how the story should go, how you should be treating them, what should be happening, when it should be happening- What sense would that make?\nI'll tell you what. It makes no sense.\nThe trouble with autonomous characters is fairly simple: You are giving your control as a creator over to something that you created, as opposed to taking that control and using it to flesh out this creation as best you can as a creator. Once you have convinced yourself that, \"Hey, my characters have minds of their own. They can think for themselves.\nThey are their own person.\nThey can do what they want!\" you are basically signing yourself up for a backseat-driver that can be as difficult as they damn well please. Once you have that, you have a dozen excuses for why you aren't writing, and a bigger problem than the plot hole you started off with.\nYou have a giant, leeching beetle on your shoulder there.\nThis character, once you've let it decide that it is indeed as real as you are, is bound to create an uphill battle for your progress. They might decide to just stop talking to you, right when you were thinking your draft was just about done, leaving you high and dry for progress or motivation; or worse, they will change their minds about everything you decided beforehand, and decide that they will not love Billy no matter how much you need them to love Billy, and instead they will love Amar, because face it Amar is way hotter than Billy could ever dream of being.\nThis sort of thing leaves you floating from \"between a rock and a hard place\" and \"so frustrated I could tear my hair out\".\nThe problem isn't your character!\nThe problem is that you, the author, decided to give your control over to something you created, under the false pretenses of \"getting to know them better\" for writing purposes. We all know why you did it. You wanted this to be easier, less of a hassle, more\n. The trouble with that is... well, you already know the trouble with that. That's why you're in this predicament. You've just realized how much trouble your autonomous character actually is. So what are you going to do about it?\nI'll tell you what you should do about it.\nRip up the idea that an autonomous character is going to make your life easier. Print it out, invite some friends over, light that idea on fire with a heavy dosing of lighter fluid and watch it\n. After that, I would personally roast some s'mores over the kindling ashes. Your characters should be\nto you, as the author. They should be under your control. You, as the author and creator of these characters, should be able to construct them in such a way that it would be really easy to think they were real. You should know everything about them, every quirk, every mannerism, and every bad habit down to the fact that they sometimes pretend that their action figure collection holds value outside of their sentimental connection to it. \"But how on earth do I figure all of that out without talking to them, Teva?\"\nYou'll probably need to plan and plot quit a lot, but you still have to write. The best way to see how a character responds to a situation is to put them in it. Would that character\ngive up being with Billy for the sake of Amar’s hotness, or did you write them in a way that Billy’s sensibility would win out in their final decision? If you really must know absolutely everything about your character, write some non-story scenes that test your character’s personality, and use it as a reference for things that happen in your works. Put yourself in that character's place by practicing their dialogue. Write a journal from their perspective, if you wish. At the end of the day, you just have to remember two things:\nYour characters aren't real, and you are in control.\nwindow.POST_ID = 't3_17l9nk';\nconst e=\"image\",t=\"video\",i=\"embed\",n=\"devvit\",d=\"no_media\",o=\"unknown\",r=[\"SHREDDIT-PLAYER-2\",\"SHREDDIT-PLAYER-STATIC-HLSJS\"];function a(e){return performance.mark(\"post-consumption-ready\",{detail:{mediaType:e}})}function s(){if(!window.POST_ID)return void console.error(\"[post-load-performance-mark] POST_ID not found\");const s=document.querySelector(`shreddit-post[id=${window.POST_ID}] div[slot=\"post-media-container\"], shreddit-post[id=${window.POST_ID}] shreddit-post-text-body`)?.querySelector(\"shreddit-player-2, shreddit-player-static-hlsjs, img, video, shreddit-embed, shreddit-tweet-embed, shreddit-devvit-ui-loader\");s&&function(e,t={}){const{checkInViewport:i=!0,requireVisible:n=!1}=t,d=e.getBoundingClientRect(),o=window.innerHeight||document.documentElement.clientHeight,r=window.innerWidth||document.documentElement.clientWidth;let a=!0;if(i){const e=d.bottom>0&&d.right>0&&d.top<o&&d.left<r;a=a&&e}if(n){const t=window.getComputedStyle(e),i=d.width>0&&d.height>0&&\"none\"!==t.display&&\"hidden\"!==t.visibility&&\"0\"!==t.opacity;a=a&&i}return a}(s)?async function(d){if(!d)return;const s=d.tagName;let c=o,m=d;if(s.endsWith(\"-EMBED\")&&(c=i,await customElements.whenDefined(d.tagName.toLowerCase()),await d.updateComplete,m=d.shadowRoot.querySelector(\"iframe\")),\"SHREDDIT-DEVVIT-UI-LOADER\"===s)return c=n,void d.addEventListener(\"devvit-app-first-render\",(()=>a(c)),{once:!0});if(r.includes(s))return c=t,d.autoplay?void d.videoElement.addEventListener(\"playing\",(()=>a(c)),{once:!0}):(await customElements.whenDefined(d.tagName.toLowerCase()),await d.updateComplete,void a(c));if(m&&\"VIDEO\"===m.tagName)return c=t,void m.addEventListener(\"loadeddata\",(()=>a(c)));m&&\"IMG\"===m.tagName&&(c=e,m.complete)?a(c):m&&m.addEventListener(\"load\",(()=>{a(c)}))}(s):a(d)}\"undefined\"==typeof window||window.process?.env?.WTR_TEST||window.SKIP_POST_LOAD_PERF_MARK_AUTO_RUN||s();export{s as init};\nOpen comment sort options\nMy characters are real, and they are in control.

I can do this with revision in the earlier parts of the story. Thank you, RoseAnn, wherever you are.\nThis certainly is interesting, considering that for the past few months, I've been doing some writing about a character who is given absolute independence and then told she is a character in a fictional work. Much of the latter story is looking at how that makes her grow as a person, what her choices are, and her eventual escape. She constantly talks to the \"author\" who acts as a guide throughout.\nI don't think letting your characters grow on their own is a bad thing. Already Emily has done one or two things that weren't planned, one of which is actually pretty huge. To me, it makes for an interesting story - if I can't predict what she's going to do, the reader certainly can't.\nI would read a book about that.\nStranger than Fiction\nI've never actually heard of that. I'll look it up and get back to you =p\nEDIT: Ooooh, that! The concepts are somewhat similar, but mine is about escaping from the book entirely... and travelling into other works of fiction. I intend to be much more meta by eventually having my character converse with the reader themselves.\nThis really seems to take an extreme view on how autonomous character creation works out. If someone is having enough trouble keeping control of their characters that they're unable to enact any sort of control over them whatsoever, they've got a much bigger problem on their hands. That's not character creation anymore. That's a failure to separate reality from fiction, and maybe an overactive sense of empathy.\nWouldn't a mix be somewhat ideal, at that? At least if the idea of autonomous character creation is being considered to be as strong as what you're saying. Fleshing characters out, and giving them solid behaviours, personality aspects, and such, helps create believable, natural characters who are\nto act on some semblance of \"their own\", and make them sound more like people in the narrative. Without that sort off depth, you risk shallow, programmed characterization that, as it's stemmed from a desire to move the plot along, feels like it's been designed to do just that. If a character becomes too uncontrollable in their design process, then some discipline is needed. In a story, you're arguably playing God, so why would they get the final say, even as people? It may sound harsh, but us writers aren't benevolent deities.\nAnd, if they manage to surprise us, by working around our (Often cruel) plans, then that may very well make the narrative more exciting. If it can surprise the writer, then shouldn't it have an even better chance at surprising the audience?\nBut yes, discipline. Discipline is important.\nIf you’ve ever been to NaNoWriMo, spoken to a “fangirl” of any sort of fiction, or visited the majority of writer’s communities (including\n), you would see that this is actually pretty common. I would go and find as many posts as I could to prove my point, but that’d be overkill, I think, you can go look for yourself. The whole idea that, “I treat my characters as people because it’s easier” is something that probably festers out of youth, loneliness, or possibly mental instability. I’m not sure I’ve met anyone who 1) didn’t start writing young, 2) wasn’t writing romance novels to live viariously through their characters, and 3) not just a titch out of their heads who used this process of character creation.\nThe idea is that you’ve created your character and, as I exemplified in the OP, treating them as a real person will make it easier for you to write them in a realistic way. They need to seem like real people on the paper, to your readers, so treating them this way as you’re writing seems logical, to those who don’t think it all the way through. If I had a dollar for every time I heard the\nmy characters stopped talking to me, help!\nquestions either here, or in some other writer’s community, I would probably have enough to pay for at least two of my application fees next year.\nWouldn't a mix be somewhat ideal, at that? […] Without that sort off depth, you risk shallow, programmed characterization that, as it's stemmed from a desire to move the plot along, feels like it's been designed to do just that. If a character becomes too uncontrollable in their design process, then some discipline is needed.\nI made up that phrase, because I needed something to call it.\nActing independently or having the freedom to do so\n, so by simple definition it really would be as I was describing it. Characters who can do and say what they feel like, when they feel like, without the writer’s input. To be honest, there’s a condition for people who talk to things they have made up like they’re real past childhood, and it’s there for a reason. Besides fostering unhealthy relationship skills for you as a person, as a writer you are setting yourself up for failure.\nIt is entirely possible, as many people have done, to create realistic characters without treating them as a real people outside of the story. They are “real people” within your storyverse, but outside of that they are nothing but words on ______ to you. Or at least if you plan on having consistency, they shouldn’t be. You should know your characters well enough to predict what they would do in a certain situation within your storyverse, you can achieve that in many ways. Journal daily through their perspective, visit something like\nand have them get interviewed, etc. etc. Taking them apart from yourself and letting them be independent of you is a generally bad idea. You’re not doing your job as a writer, author, or storyteller. You’re pawning it off on something you created.\nYour characters only exist within your mind. They cannot actually choose anything for themselves, outside of the storyverse you have created. They should be able to deal with the plot points you’ve thrown at them in a way that suits their personalities and the like, because\nshould be writing them that way. Not because they are their own creatures doing their own thinking. It is a lazy, potentially inconsistent way of writing, imo. Anyone who does this is not only cheating themselves out of the progress they could make as a writer from practicing their skills, they are also cheating themselves out of the credibility they might get when they are published. If you’re willing to say that\ndidn’t put the effort into creating the story, I’m not willing to waste my time on it. I wouldn’t go as far as to say that you’re crazy, but there are plenty of bloggers/readers out there who would, from what I’ve seen.\nTL;DR: Discipline is important, and so is skill. Writing is a skill. As a writer, you should be dedicated to practicing that skill, developing that skill, strengthening that skill, and progressing your ability as best you can. Proper characterization is a skill, and if you are going to just pawn off that responsibility to your creations because you don’t want to work hard enough to figure out how to make them real, you don’t deserve to be called a writer. You’re not writing, at that point, you are indulging the idea of imaginary friends, which is something a child is capable of.\nThe whole idea that, “I treat my characters as people because it’s easier” is something that probably festers out of youth, loneliness, or possibly mental instability. I’m not sure I’ve met anyone who 1) didn’t start writing young, 2) wasn’t writing romance novels to live viariously through their characters, and 3) not just a titch out of their heads who used this process of character creation.\nWhen you feel the need to start picking on the mentally ill, maybe it's time to unsubscribe to\n), you would see that this is actually pretty common. [...] If I had a dollar for every time I heard the my characters stopped talking to me, help! questions either here, or in some other writer’s community, I would probably have enough to pay for at least two of my application fees next year.\nAgain, you're making the assumption that all people with the habit of allowing their characters some level of freedom fall into the the same category as the extreme ones. There certainly are people out there who take things a bit too far, but they're the minority. They're the sorts who don't just give their characters freedom, but treat them as real. That's not at all what I'm advocating.\nThe characters as individuals approach on its own is, in fact, so common that it has\narticles written on the theory behind it\n. While the article I linked to is nothing more than speculative, it explains the concept of characters treated as individuals better than I probably can, and helps illustrate a major point I'm trying to make. This sort of thinking, on a non-extreme level, is quite common. For it to qualify as a \"condition\", on its very own, it would have to be a hell of a lot less so.\nAlso, a lot of cases of people claiming that their \"characters have stopped talking to them\" are really just people expressing a writers block with different wording. I think I can safely say that most of them aren't literally panicking because they can't get their characters to talk to them anymore.\nI'll stop using it, then. There's no point in arguing the meaning of a phrase with the person who invented it. By the sound of it, it only applies to your extreme definition, so it doesn't apply to any of my arguments, anyways.\nYou’re not doing your job as a writer, author, or storyteller. You’re pawning it off on something you created.\nWhat is my job as a writer, author, or storyteller? There are tons of ways to answer this question, and I wasn't aware that many of them were more \"right\" than any others. Also, how can I pawn something off to my own brain? That doesn't even make any sense.\nYour characters only exist within your mind. They cannot actually choose anything for themselves, outside of the storyverse you have created.\nI never thought otherwise. There's a difference between allowing characters some level of separation in your mind from your own personality, and thinking of them as real.\nIt is a lazy, potentially inconsistent way of writing, imo. Anyone who does this is not only cheating themselves out of the progress they could make as a writer from practicing their skills, they are also cheating themselves out of the credibility they might get when they are published. If you’re willing to say that you didn’t put the effort into creating the story, I’m not willing to waste my time on it. I wouldn’t go as far as to say that you’re crazy, but there are plenty of bloggers/readers out there who would, from what I’ve seen.\nWhat does \"lazy\" even mean by these standards? Shouldn't the ideal method of creating something be the one that creates the best output with the least effort? How is creating a character in the \"people\" part of the brain not practicing a skill? How is it less credible, especially if this theoretical person has apparently gotten published in the first place?\nYou’re not writing, at that point, you are indulging the idea of imaginary friends, which is something a child is capable of.\nYes. They're also capable of speech. Are people who pursue practiced speech as a skill in adulthood less \"credible\" because the skill they're using was one that they learned the basics of when they were two?\nIf you asked me what my favorite color was, I might say purple. I probably wouldn't explain that I actually only say that because it's one of the few colors I think suits me, even though I really don't have a particularly favorite color.\nIt's kind of funny that in talking about how character interviews aren't useful, you provide an example of how they can be useful. If you're not going to put any effort into thinking why purple is someone's favorite color, there's no point. Your detailed answer provides us with some information: this person would rather just go with the flow instead of saying, \"I don't really have a favorite color,\" because answers like that just elicit more questions. They have some opinion about their clothes (rather than just being indifferent to them). If you wanted to pick a main sense for this character, sight would probably be a bad choice, given the fact that they don't really react strongly to color. Touch, smell, hearing, would be better options.\nAnd the closest I've ever come to having writers block was when I sat down to actually plot something scene-by-scene. As a pantser who writes character driven narratives, I'm used to dealing with the sensation of my characters going \"off script\" and for me, it's really just a challenge. And while it can be frustrating, it's a good kind of frustrating, a puzzle that when solved is very satisfying.\nI never said that the interviews weren’t useful. I said that that begins the process of creating a divide between you, the author, and the character you have created.\nI don’t know how many other ways I can say it’s a bad idea, so I won’t try. I’m just convinced that it is.\nIt might be--for you. It's just, you're not everyone. If you look at the variety of novels out there, surely it can't be surprising that people write them in a variety of manners?\nI took a class with Shanna Germain, and she talked about autonomous characters, how your story wants to be a certain length. Obviously your characters aren't real, and your story doesn't have an opinion on its word count. What she was talking about his how you conception of your character changes as you write them, and you end up with this sensation of them going \"off script.\" When she was talking about story length, it's really another way of saying, \"You have this much plot, it will work for about this much words. Too much or too little, the story will feel stretched or rushed.\" The reality is, writers can be just as creative in describing their problems as they can be with their writing.\n.snoo-cls-11,.snoo-cls-9{stroke-width:0}.snoo-cls-9{fill:#842123}.snoo-cls-11{fill:#ffc49c}\nreReddit: Top posts of January 30, 2013\nreReddit: Top posts of January 2013\nreReddit: Top posts of 2013\nReddit, Inc. © 2025.

If someone is having enough trouble keeping control of their characters that they're unable to enact any sort of control over them whatsoever, they've got a much bigger problem on their hands. That's not character creation anymore. That's a failure to separate reality from fiction, and maybe an overactive sense of empathy.\nIf you’ve ever been to NaNoWriMo, spoken to a “fangirl” of any sort of fiction, or visited the majority of writer’s communities (including r/writing), you would see that this is actually pretty common. I would go and find as many posts as I could to prove my point, but that’d be overkill, I think, you can go look for yourself. The whole idea that, “I treat my characters as people because it’s easier” is something that probably festers out of youth, loneliness, or possibly mental instability. I’m not sure I’ve met anyone who 1) didn’t start writing young, 2) wasn’t writing romance novels to live viariously through their characters, and 3) not just a titch out of their heads who used this process of character creation.\nThe idea is that you’ve created your character and, as I exemplified in the OP, treating them as a real person will make it easier for you to write them in a realistic way. They need to seem like real people on the paper, to your readers, so treating them this way as you’re writing seems logical, to those who don’t think it all the way through. If I had a dollar for every time I heard the my characters stopped talking to me, help! questions either here, or in some other writer’s community, I would probably have enough to pay for at least two of my application fees next year.\nWouldn't a mix be somewhat ideal, at that? […] Without that sort off depth, you risk shallow, programmed characterization that, as it's stemmed from a desire to move the plot along, feels like it's been designed to do just that. If a character becomes too uncontrollable in their design process, then some discipline is needed.\nI made up that phrase, because I needed something to call it. Autonomous means Acting independently or having the freedom to do so, so by simple definition it really would be as I was describing it. Characters who can do and say what they feel like, when they feel like, without the writer’s input. To be honest, there’s a condition for people who talk to things they have made up like they’re real past childhood, and it’s there for a reason. Besides fostering unhealthy relationship skills for you as a person, as a writer you are setting yourself up for failure.\nIt is entirely possible, as many people have done, to create realistic characters without treating them as a real people outside of the story. They are “real people” within your storyverse, but outside of that they are nothing but words on ______ to you. Or at least if you plan on having consistency, they shouldn’t be. You should know your characters well enough to predict what they would do in a certain situation within your storyverse, you can achieve that in many ways. Journal daily through their perspective, visit something like r/IAmAFiction and have them get interviewed, etc. etc. Taking them apart from yourself and letting them be independent of you is a generally bad idea. You’re not doing your job as a writer, author, or storyteller. You’re pawning it off on something you created.\nAnd, if they manage to surprise us, by working around our (Often cruel) plans, then that may very well make the narrative more exciting. If it can surprise the writer, then shouldn't it have an even better chance at surprising the audience?\nYour characters only exist within your mind. They cannot actually choose anything for themselves, outside of the storyverse you have created. They should be able to deal with the plot points you’ve thrown at them in a way that suits their personalities and the like, because you should be writing them that way. Not because they are their own creatures doing their own thinking. It is a lazy, potentially inconsistent way of writing, imo. Anyone who does this is not only cheating themselves out of the progress they could make as a writer from practicing their skills, they are also cheating themselves out of the credibility they might get when they are published.

I probably wouldn't explain that I actually only say that because it's one of the few colors I think suits me, even though I really don't have a particularly favorite color.\nIt's kind of funny that in talking about how character interviews aren't useful, you provide an example of how they can be useful. If you're not going to put any effort into thinking why purple is someone's favorite color, there's no point. Your detailed answer provides us with some information: this person would rather just go with the flow instead of saying, \"I don't really have a favorite color,\" because answers like that just elicit more questions. They have some opinion about their clothes (rather than just being indifferent to them). If you wanted to pick a main sense for this character, sight would probably be a bad choice, given the fact that they don't really react strongly to color. Touch, smell, hearing, would be better options.\nAnd the closest I've ever come to having writers block was when I sat down to actually plot something scene-by-scene. As a pantser who writes character driven narratives, I'm used to dealing with the sensation of my characters going \"off script\" and for me, it's really just a challenge.
