This uniqueness came from the imagination and inspirations of the game developpers. For the moment the AI is just a tool for game developpers but it makes us wonder if some day it will be able to produce on its own original ideas and manage to create better games than game devs...

Their roadmap is a big update every 2 months (except the first one that'll be in May instead of June), so keep your eyes open for May, August, October and December!

It's already a great experience. I am playing The Early Access and I was on there for hours which I haven't been on a simulation game like that in years so it's giving something that is needed in this genre. And quite frankly The Sims dropped the ball after Sims 3. They dropped the ball and went for some kiddie BS. Instead of continuing to forward the game with more content they went backwards so they needed this competition. They created this competition because people were tired of paying through the nose for the same crap and for stuff they never even asked for. So I am very happy about InZoi!

What hit me like a truck is that, very very soon, we will see creative industries that mimic… the egg industry. No, not because both have stuff that fire out of our backsides (though, I’m sure you’ve all got a publisher in mind that you could argue does that) - but because, to me, generative AI is a bit like those ultra-inhumane, cruel chicken batteries where they basically squeeze forty eggs out of a raggedy hen each day, and you get charged pennies to have them. Some people will buy them, because… well, that’s the most eggs you can get for your money, so who cares how you got them? More eggs, and nobody needs to think too hard about how we got them. Others, however, are willing to spend a bit more to know the hens were fed chocolate gateau and given massages, and despite them costing a bit more, you can REALLY tell the difference (and, besides - you get to feel good, knowing you supported a kinder, more thoughtful world). As this scales beyond the point of any reasonable control, there’ll be an “artisan resurgence” in the games industry, and “all human-made” will be a badge of honour. No doubt, there’ll be associated costs there (though I doubt the AAA folks will sacrifice profit to bring down game RRPs, we’ll likely see bigger games take less time to make as more and more genAI is shoehorned in - human-made games will take longer, and that’ll be the tradeoff). Do you choose the battery farmed eggs, or the organic, free-range ones? Do you choose the rapidly-built AI games, or the more methodical, time-hungry human-made ones? Ultimately, that boils down to what you want - if you just want game fast, at any cost, or if you’d rather your games were built with every facet considered with human intention. (on the topic of food - in my personal opinion, generative AI is a bit like pee in a pot of soup. How much pee in your pot of soup do you like? How much will you tolerate? Some people might not care, so long as they can’t taste it. For me, just knowing ANY in there is enough to make me order a salad instead.)

If you shoot enemies they take cover, and if you keep shooting they don't pop up and shoot. Instead they lift their guns above the cover and fire blindly in the direction they think you are in. If you stop firing they quickly check by popping out their heads. So what I did was that I sprinted around a bunch of junk and came up beside the guy. He still turned around and checked behind himself to see if I was still there. Then he turned his head towards me and stated \"SHIT.\" A third example is in Crysis, the most tense and immersive fight I ever had in an FPS. There is this small cemetry in the forest where you are supposed to extract. Yet in this area there are four enemies with nanosuits, sniper rifles and SMGs. In case you are unaware of what this means, they are invisible and once you shoot them they switch to armour. Taking a whole magazine of bullets without dropping. But since I was already aware of them being in the area I cloaked and snuck towards the place. Lying beneath a bush and trying to spot the camoflaged enemies through the damp mist. Occasionally I could see someone in the distance, sitting as their nanosuit regained its energy. More often I heard their footsteps but couldn't see them. If you make any noise they begin to quitely track you down. And if you are revealed you can expect fire from all direction and die. It probably took over an hour as I tried to sneak closer and closer to an individual enemy, then broke stealth and emptied a magazine of incendiary ammo into one. Then stealthed as I snuck away to hide under another bush. One by one, bush and tree, step by step until I had found every single one.

While the replica was more advanced than the AI \"companions\" of today, that episode was part of the second season which was released in 2013, way before ChatGPT or other AI LLMs, yet the parallels are so shockingly similar, even with differing selling points between the AIs from the Black Mirror episode and the ones we have.",

We have been here before. When you have a hammer, everything starts to look like a nail. The question is not whether AI goes against us, but whether we are using it with purpose or just swinging it around. Banning or rejecting AI feels odd when you think about it. AI is not the catalyst; people are. The problem is not that AI replaces skill; it is that many skilled people have not yet explored how it can amplify their capability. When creative, curious minds start using AI to extend their craft rather than defend their turf, the conversation will shift from fear to fluency.",

While watching an 80's or 90's movie, I heard a teenager ask \"did teenagers really have parties like that? I've never even heard of anyone having a party for teenagers in my school.\" It was so sad. We destroyed our selves. We took away what made us human and fun. The 16-18 year old had never been to a party. None of their friends either. They didn't even understand the kids threw the parties. They thought the parents had to organize it or something. When I was a teen we used to rent rooms arenas or community centers and have punk rock shows. Bands of other teens punk rockers. Made money off door and drinks to pay for it all. Kids now can't even throw a party? This is sad and scary. This happened in one generation.",
