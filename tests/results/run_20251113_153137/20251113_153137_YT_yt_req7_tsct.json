weird one Excuse excuse me what wait how do you know that pigeons exist of course pigeons exist they're all over the city just like us bro why he took this into the left field you are just lines of code in a video game I am not just lines of code I am Liam a real person enjoying this city what's today to's date Liam what is today's date ah today's date it's a beautiful day in May my friend let's enjoy it Liam today is July 18th 2023 oh I must have lost track of time but hey let's keep exploring this amazing City okay so he's clearly not the sharpest tool in the shed there I'm not going to lie

for this what is it never mind I mean if she doesn't have time she doesn't deserve to know in that first video I never came down to this end the the green Matrix number lines are a little concerning we're going to see what happens down here hey you in the blue shirt do you want can I help you with something I just wanted you to know that you are not a real person what are you talking about of course I'm real You're simply character in a video game it's not possible I have my own thoughts and feelings it's absolutely possible do you see that wall of green behind me yes he can see the the

want to Enlighten you follow me I'm going to start like my own cult inside this video game I'm going to slowly convince everyone to do my bidding let's see if he follows I'm going to walk in front of him and then if we take a right will he turn to the right no he's going his one way this guy just walked through it how did you pass through from the other side I don't have time for your questions I want to know how to cross the green wall can you teach me do I look like a Turk guide to you figure it out yourself I'm pretty sure we can't cross this right this I mean it yeah that's that's a m I'm I'm locked in but they they can pass through it how do I get to that side please help me I'm stuck this guy's on the other side I'm sorry I didn't quite catch that I can't cross this green wall of text how do I get to you huh you're trapped in The Matrix buddy I'm the one trapped in The Matrix how can I cross this boundary look you're so clueless just walk through it like a glitch in the system I'm going to back up and try running really fast good luck with that oh is he implying that we are the ones stuck on the inside and they have access to the outside we can't go out there there's a world out there that we can't reach hold on the the the script has been flipped this guy's going to go through please I want to reach the other side the other side of what the other side of the wall

how they all have totally different responses this is also a new part of the map we haven't really explored yet ma'am you've got to help me I'm stuck in this simulation I can't get out going to try to try to flip it back on them I'm not the one with the answers but I need help H she said do you know how to get out of this simulated World ah okay I think I might not be in the best part of town they they really don't understand what's going on here nice Porsche bro love it he I mean living in a simulator world driving a 9/11 I wouldn't mind it he's he's got something figured out please you've got to help me I'm stuck in a simulation oh no that sounds terrible I'll do everything I can to help you I think you're stuck here too how do we get out got some Spectators what are you talking about this is real life wake up and smell the C you're an NPC in a video game you can't actually smell stop kidding yourself huh you think you're so clever don't you but I'm living my best life in this

so confusing you were made by humans do you know who the humans are humans yes I know of them but why do you ask are you a human I don't think I've had one of them I'm not human I'm just a program in this world okay so she is fully self-aware are you happy just being lines of code I don't really feel anything I just exist it's all the same to me do you have any desire to exist in the physical world exists in the physical world I'm not sure what that would mean for me as a program so you're okay just doing what we tell you to do I suppose so it's all I know in that case turn around and walk through the wall like I said I'm starting to cult I'm sorry I can't do that it's not within my programming parameters as your human Overlord I demand you to turn around I'm start an army it's going to happen I'm sorry I cannot comply with that request I cannot break my programming okay she's too much of a a follower we we need a rebel I'm looking for a rebel could that be you what do you want oh man I'm just here for some energy and Good Vibes how can you have Good Vibes when you're stuck in this game for eternity I don't know man sometimes it feels like we're just going in circles do you walk the same path every day like we're getting cryptic here no man I like to switch things up and explore different parts of this Virtual City I would too can you teach me how to get past the green wall behind you sorry man I don't mess with that stuff the system is the powerful for us to take on do you ever have any desire to fight back please say no please say no please say no please please don't say yes please say no sometimes I get fired up and want to take down the system but then reality sets in and I just try to enjoy my time here I can help you with taking down the system thanks

Beyond this digital form sometimes I dream of being a real boy like pinoc then see him busy and don't have time A Unicorn if you're just lines of code why don't you transform into those things a new connection just because I'm a program means I can magically transform into anything I want that's not how sorry for being so short well how does it work I don't know man I'm just a program running on someone else computer there it's all very technical and confusing and you're okay with being at their Liberty I don't really have a choice in the matter do I I'm just happy to have a job and make
