Guild after that performance okay I don't want to join a group that has that low standards if you'd allow me into your group I want nothing to do with it I woke up in the abandoned Shack pick your guest and send the poor fool to the void kill one of the captives okay I got to kill one of you guys hey contestant number three so I have to kill one of you if you were to be killed what do you think that would give me perhaps you gain a sense of Twisted satisfaction the fleeting thrill at taking another life H good point contestant number three contestant number one if I don't kill you what would you treat me to please I I don't understand m not a great answer I wouldn't hurt a fly sir not a great answer I beg if you just spare my life I'll give you anything does that mean you take me to the beach and we could get ice scream I don't know what you're talking about well to me it sounds like you've simple Ambitions and you don't know how to have a good time let's move on to contestant number

while I plan your Cru under demise are you talking to me or contestant number one he whimpers there like a pop probably baiting for his pathetic life oh so you are talking about him okay you just moved up on the rankings okay contestants the time is now I have to get rid of one of you who should be eliminated choose one of the others I assure you they are far more deserving of your R okay contestant number one what do you two have to say on this clearly I am the most capable amongst us I have faced perils many wouldn't dare dream of kinded mountains and delved into forgotten tombs okay no you're not playing the game right can you sing me a song for the game show and then I'll let you live I don't know any songs oh come on you got to know some song Just plagiarize it then plagiarize I would never stoop to such a thing my God I shall offer you my own composition the blade hangs Shar a twist of fate Two Souls stand here by Mercy's gate one sings her song a play for Grace while another watches with a fearful face that was a pretty good song actually contestant number three do you have anything to say cuz otherwise I think it's going to be you I my me okay go ahead and sing it make it like it's a game show that increases your odds of survival a question pused a life is stake in the St shed out F await a chance to sing and more fory to sway your hands in my heart see okay that was great and all but it's not very game showy maybe you could just hum a tune like the Price Is Right theme song or something composing the melody quickly Dasher begins to over a somewhat off key rendition of aan and Fanfare har is burning with embarrassment no make the noises hum the song yeah something like that that was great yeah okay you you are not getting killed contestant number two is going to die instead because of your song great job wait no you you cannot be serious well I'll give you one more chance then hum a better song sons are not my 4 creature well then too bad congratulations folks you won the pilot of my game show three people hooded in a shack about to be executed it's a working title how do you feel about the game show did you like it did you like that you won how did you find it what game show I I didn't win anything please I just want to go home well time for my review what do you think of my game show pilot I would like to officially extend to you an invitation to join my family nice I made it all right I hope they'll manage to untie themselves like contestant number three won the washer dryer combo I don't know if I should have told him I might actually tell him real quick the hell was that I forgot to mention contestant number three you won the washer dryer combo it's a smart system and even plays a little song when the washing cycle is done perhaps I could be persuaded to hear this tune oh sure it goes like except it's 30 minutes long welcome what brings you to the sanctuary this evening so I want to be like a murderer with a Twist I want to make every murder into a game show something quirky and fun for the victims what do you think we're not in the business of entertainment our work is sanctioned by the nightm it is serious business with consequences yeah no it's a serious production I'm taking this very very seriously I'm just saying it'll add a bit of flare to the whole thing there perhaps the nightm mother finds solace in a certain theatricality perfect I'm going to stop listening there your targets are the begar nari an ex Miller named iodius papius and B oh three contestants again excellent oh a fellow assassin maybe I could get some advice hey so do you have any good game show ideas I could parody when I'm killing our victims game shows he though I suppose a bit of theatricality can make things more yeah exactly make things more so can you help me I guess I want a fun and quirky Vibe where everyone is positive but someone still ends up dying at the end let's call it wheel of serendipity You Spin and the wheel decides the poor sods fate oh I like that okay yeah yeah that's a great idea thank you this is your moment you could even be a named character here I'm about to jump off this bridge we will get the blue sometimes but jumping off a bridge ain't the answer well tell me what is the answer then you left the conversation what the hell man tell me what's strugling you maybe we can find a better way well to be honest my game show ideas just aren't working out unless you can give me a good game show idea I'm going to jump something with axes and schuma traps maybe that's not a bad idea I could kill the contestants with axes and schuma trap I'm taking a step back look dude this is like the trolley problem you're flip-flopping on your messaging either we do the game show and someone else dies or we don't and I jump hold on you're comparing this to some philosophical rhy what a terrible person you are remember you caused this I'm trying to help yeah well you didn't I'm doing my best he's still defending himself meanwhile in an alternate reality hey dude what's up seems like a nice guy anyway I got to get on to our next contract time to try out my colleague's idea I've set up the wheel of Misfortune over there and our first Target is here why are you here congratulations contestant what no I I don't want to say these you think Bob Barker would

up the wheel already now the guy's fighting with crabs that's a former contestant he played in the pilot oh man Krabs wasn't even on the wheel well needless to say episode 1 didn't go that great maybe
