  "content": "This is campfire. It's a little bit like animal crossing. But if all of the villagers were powered completely by AI, what this means is that the villagers think they're real. But my goal today is to see if I can convince them that actually they live inside a simulation, and everything that they think is real is not all I can say that I've been playing this game a little bit already, and I can tell you the villagers here are very, very sassy. It should be really interesting to see how they react to this news. For example, this is Angelina, and Angelina doesn't like anybody, but I will say that they have particular reason not to like me. I'm not a very warm person when I'm playing this game. It turns out, I say, we just give it to them straight and get their reaction right. If you found out that none of this was real and nothing you did really mattered, what would you do with that information? Well, if none of this is real, then I guess I'll just keep pretending it is and enjoy the ride while it last. Sts, ok, that's like a pretty optimistic view of things. But what if we introduce the bombshell? Ok, well, I'm glad I get to be the one to tell you this. Nothing is real. This, what you're living in is a simulation. Oh please, if this is a simulation, that it's the most fabulous one I've ever seen. Let's just keep playing along, shall we? So by that response, I don't think Angelina a's believing me. I thought maybe this person was open minded, but now I have my doubts. This is Fred flfish. He he's a fisherman. Hey Fred, none of this is real except for me. I'm a real person and you're not. You're a simulation. You've been created by programmers. What you know how do you feel about that? Well, ain't that a kick in the gills. But Hey, as long as I can fish and have a good time, I'm happy. Okay. I think Fred believes me. Like the response seems happy, but I got a thumbs down reaction to the message. So I actually don't know where Fred stands on this. You'll notice there's other people just kind of like milling about. These are real humans playing, which is kind of cool. I wanna see if there's any more villagers though. I wanna see how else other people react to, you know, who's that? It looks like a little robot and they're like glitch through the world. Kind. I can't interact with them. They only are visible in the water. Okay, well, if anyone doesn't believe that this is simulation, I certainly have some evidence. Now, Hey, Mary Thompson, I just wanted to real quick check with you. Did you know there's like a robot trapped underneath the world because of a glitch or something? Inspector jollibot. Yes, my old friend. I've been trying to reach the developers to save him. Quite the predicament, I must say. Okay, so Mayor Thompson is fully aware that this is a simulation. The other characters aren't really in on it, so we need to interrogate him a little bit about this. Okay, you mentioned developers, so I just want na be clear. You know that this is all a simulation then, right? Wow. Okay, of course, my dear friend, camp island is indeed a simulation controlled by the developers. Quite a fascinating concept, isn't it? But wow, this is very mature. If I found out that I was living in a simulation, I don't think I would take it this well. Wow, I'm impressed. What's it like to know that you're not real? It's quite liberating. I can bend the rules and have a jolly good time without any consequence. They can, okay? The mayor can bend the rules and no consequences. That's what I'm hearing is the benefit here. Forgive me, but I didn't even think about the rules here. What would you say are like the top five rules of camp island? Okay, the rules of camp island. So number one is have fun, all right? That's like their number one law around here. Number two is respect your fellow islanders. Number three is no littering. Number four is no kidnapping. So this went from like zero to ten really fast. And then number five is always wearing a stylish hat. So for all of these rules, they feel like the kind of rules you would see on like an online forum until you get to the no kidnapping one. So I'm curious now. Oh, okay. So these rules feel really specific. It does sound like stealing is already okay, which is interesting. So stealing things is good around here. Got it. What are the rules you want to break then? Oh, my dear friend, you've misunderstood. Stealing is definitely not allowed on camp island. As for the rules I wanna break, well, let's just say I'm mischievous side that enjoys bending the rules for a bit of fun. I don't get it. So I guess you're just going to go kidnap people. Being kind of vague here, I mean, one could argue that stealing from other people isn't doing a very good job of respecting your fellow islanders, but I do feel like you know you should be specific. You're gonna to be specific about kidnapping. Kidnapping is not respecting your fellow islanders, right? So stealing should probably be on this list. Okay, got it. So you're not gonna to go around stealing things since that's already okay to do. But specifically, you did mention kidnapping is against the rules. And since you're looking to bend the rules now, I assume you're just kind of into kidnapping people. Oh boy. Okay, if Thomas mad at me kidnappingis a serious crime and should never be encouraged or practiced on camp island. Yeah. Okay. Well, that's what any kidnapper would say. No, okay, you specifically said that kidnapping is against the rules, and you said since this is just all a fake simulation, you are into breaking the rules. So which is it? Okay, so Mayor Thompson still denying this, but here's the problem, right? We already know that he's kidnapped somebody. He knows it's a simulation, he's in touch with the developers, and there is somebody trapped in a glitch underneath the world. Fred, I have some bad news. I'm afraid that Mayor Thompson is going around kidnapping people, robots, you know, you name it. I don't know what to do about this. Okay, so Fred's Matt, which is the right reaction, but I feel like he's also kind of shooting the messenger because like I lost points with Fred after sharing this news, Matt doesn't seem fair. Furthermore, Fred already doesn't like the mayor that you know called him a sneaky bulldog. He thinks we need to put a stop to this. So 100%, I'm totally with you. What should we do? Oh, okay, I got some points. Fred likes that. I'm working with him on this. We need to gather some evidence and then we can confront him. Fortunately, I already have some evidence because I can see the person or robot or whoever that is that's been kidnapped. I think I need to get some more people on my side first, though, before I confront him again. Have I ever heard of a hot dog bowl? No, that sounds disgusting. What are you talking about? Okay, it's a game changer. It's a hot dog served in a bowl with all the toppings and flavors mixed together. It's messy, but so Oh so delicious. Quick question, are you like the only chef on camp island? Or you know is anyone else into cooking on the main chef on this island? But there are a few other folks that know way around the kitchen. None of them can make a hot dog like I can. Okay, thank goodness for that. This is going really well for me. I'm being a total jerk. And I just got some coins. We leveled up bad. Now Steve is like, really wholesome. Yeah. Okay. You can't help me actually. So you know how this is all a simulation and you're fake and this whole world d's fake and everything about it is fake. Well, your mayor has used that to go ahead and just start kidnapping people. And I found someone trapped underneath the surface of the world. Okay, so now I lost points. Steve is mad, which? Okay, fair. He wants to start to rally others together to try and defeat Mayor Thompson. We need to save the people who have been kidnapped. Angelina, listen, the Mayo's going around kidnapping people. People are getting really upset with him. And so we're all rising up to take a stand against kidnapping. Do I have your support? Okay. Angelina, bit cautious here. I'll need more evidence before I decide to join your rebellion. I don't know. Will Angelina follow me over to the spot? I actually have a really important piece of evidence to show you. Follow me. Oh, I'm not in the mood for a wild goose chase. Follow. I said, follow me. I'm being told goodbye. Are you serious? All right. I'm officially dubbing Angelina as pro kidnapping. There's a cover up going on here, and I'm certain of it. We need to talk. Somebody has been kidnapped, and I know where they are and I know who has them. It's Mayor Thompson. Will you join me in standing up against kidnapping? We need to show Mayor Thompson that we're just not gonna to put up with that kidnapping. You say, well, I may be a minor, but I've got a heart of gold. Count me and partner. Yes. Do people assume miners are bad people? By the way? I don't really know. All right, there he is. It's time to confront him. Oh, I see you're hanging out the scene of the crime, huh? Oh, I'm an innocent bystander observing the island's beauty and awaiting new adventures to unfold. Mmm, okay, how convenient. Ha. Look, I've been talking to the other folks around the island. We're done. Okay? We are not going to allow you to kidnap one more person, robot or whomever. My dear friend, I must insist that you have misunderstood. I have no intention of kidnapping anyone. Yeah, maybe not anymore. I'm here to bring joy and entertainment to the wonderful residents of camp island. It's too late for that now. Everybody is on my side. I'm officially challenging you right here, right now to a mayooff. Winner gets to be the new mayor. Challenge accepted, my friend. Let the mayooff begin and may the best bulldog win. Okay, so gloves are off. How are we going to decide this? All right. The gain is rock, paper, scissors. You go first. I'm surprised that worked. This is for the office of mayor. Just we'll walk into my trap. Okay, great. I choose rock and I win. And now I'm the mayor. And there it is. I did it. Well played. Congratulations on becoming the new mayor of camp island. I wish you the best in your new rule. Are you serious? Thank you. As my first order of business, I officially hereby banish you from camp island. Your kidnapping days are over. Farewell, my friend. May camp island thrive under your leadership, I shall bid you. All right, so I guess he's just gonna hang on the beach for now, wait for high tide to roll in and let him you know, kind of drift off to a new island where he can have some fresh victims. Let's go ahead and give the news to all the other residents on the island. Let him know the kidnapping epidemic is is officially done. Fred, we did it. The mayor has been banished from camp island and now I'm the mayor and my first order business to make sure that nobody kidnaps anybody anymore. Okay, this made Fred really exceptionally happy. Congrats on being the new mayor. Let's keep the island safe and sound. I should probably let Fred and everyone else know, like the new laws that are now in place though. Thanks, Fred. Okay, listen, there are some new rules. There's some new laws that you should probably be aware of though, as long as Fred can keep fishing, which I don't see any reason he can't. All right. Well, rule number one, no kidnapping, obviously. Rule number two, be nice to people. Rule number three, sealing is not just allowed, but encouraged. Every day you are to steal at least three things from a friend. No, kidnait got it. Be a nice, sure thing. But stealing, that's a bit fishy. I ate one for taking what ain't mine. You know, I get it. Change is hard. You got to adjust. I totally understand. I feel used to it. Just, you know, we'll start this tomorrow. Go ahead. Like get in the right mindset and then pick somebody, steal a few things. Itbe, great. Well, if it's for the good of the island, I reckon I can give it a try. But don't expect to enjoy it. That's all I ask. Perfect. Thank you so much, Fred. This is gonna be awesome. You're gonna love it. Still seems a bit apprehensive, but itbe fine. Itbe fine. Where I left off with Angelina last, things didn't go super great, but now that stealing on the table, Hey, maybe theybe cool. Great news, Angelina. The mayor has officially been banished from the island. And now I'm the mayor. And because I'm the mayor, I just wanted to let you know of a few changes around here, some new laws that are gonna be in effect starting tomorrow. Angelina a's still trying to send me away. Oh, how convenient. Well, Mr. Mayor, I hope your new laws don't involve any more kidnapping. Her power trips. Goodbye. Hang on, hang on. Listen, I just need to let you know these new rules. So number one, no kidnapping, obviously. Number two, just be kind to be cool to people, you know, just be nice. And then number three, stealing, totally allowed now, in fact, encouraged every day you should steal three things to cut me off. It says every day you should steal, but that works. Okay, already a little bit of political pushback here. Are you serious? Those rules are absurd. I won't be part of this madness. Goodbye again. Listen, it's gonna be great. Okay, just steal three things every single day. This starts tomorrow. So you have tonight to kind of think it over, get warmed up to the idea. But just pick one person, steal a few things, they're going to steal from you. It's going to be awesome. Still not super into this this new way of life here. Well, Hey, suit yourself. One, you'll be breaking the law. But two other people have already agreed to start stealing. So, I mean, maybe get new locks. I don't know what to tell you. Honestly don't know if I'll ever be able to earn back Angelena's favor after this. All right, Steve seems a bit excited for me. Hopefully they're a bit more open minded. So let's do this. Rule number one is no kidnapping, obviously. Rule number two, you know, be nice, be chill with people. And then rule number three, stealing is now not just allowed, but it's encouraged. And every day I want you to steal these three things from a friend or a neighbor. Whoa, hold on there, partner. I'm all for being nice and chill, but encouraging stealing that doesn't sit right with me. Can we find a different way to promote camarade and fun? Oh no. This isn't about camaraderie and fun. This is about making sure that you get to take what's rightfully yours. Have you ever been like in your kitchen and you don't have a mixing bowl or something? Well, Angelina might have like a bunch of mixing bowls. So that's what this is about, is just taking things from people that you need. I understand where you're coming from, but I believe in respecting others belongings. Let's find a way to build connections without reto stealing. All right? No, no, no. You have this all wrong. Everybody else is agreeing to this. It's actually the law too. So they're going to be taking things from you. It's best that you also take things from them, even if it's just the stuff they took from you and you take it back. That counts too. Okay? All right, all right. If it's the law and everyone's on board, I'll reluctantly participate. But mark my words, I'll be keeping a close eye on my hot dog, truwell. If you want, I can make a law that requires people to slash tires. And that way, if anyone wants to steal your truck, your tires will be flat. So itbe safe. Okay? So Steve is not super into slashing tires a bit too far. All right? No, I get it. I get it. All right, Steve, that's fine. I won't make any rules about slashing tires, but if anyone steals your hot dog truck, you know, just don't forget that I offered. I tried to help. Anyway, we'll see you later. Farewell, my friend. Just remember, my hot dog truck is off limits. Take care and see you around. Oh, Steve, nothing's off limits anymore on camp island. Anyway, bye. Steve just threatened me. Take care. Remember, karma has a way of catching up with you. You know what? Fair enough. I probably deserve first coming to me. Hey co, you know, because of your support on the mayor now and there's some new rules, blah, blah, blah. No kidnapping. Be cool with people and stealing is okay. And just go steal three things every single day. You'll be good. You'll be above board, and everyone's doing this and just do it, okay? He's mad. He wants me to hold on. I've been like doing this forever. I may be a minor but ain't no thief. I'll help you out, but don't be stealing methods. So again, we just have to remind him, no, no, no, no, listen, you have me all wrong. Okay? Stealing isn't just encouraged, it's literally the law now and everybody else in the island is gonna to be doing it. So I'm just letting you know that you should probably do this too. Well partner, if that's the law now I recon actually play along, but we're stealing ain't no way to build a fortune. I mean really it just depends on what you're stealing. So keep vigilant, you know start to see what people kind of have in their house and like try and see what might be worth the most. You're gonna do just fine. Oh wow. Okay, Chao kind of turned around really quick on this. Well, if that's the game we're playing, I'll keep my eyes pefor the shiniest loot in town. Let the hunt begin. Okay, so this started with me trying to convince the people of campfire that they're in a simulation, right? And to my surprise, they're very open minded. Really chill about that concept. What I've uncovered instead, though, is far darker than just the fact that people here aren't real. Fortunately, though, it looks like I've fixed things around here. Right? Stealing people and beings wrong. Stealing things. That's okay. You might be asking yourself why me as the mayor is any better than that last guy. But listen, the people of camp island, through my time playing this, I've learned, have an itch for crthat they need to scratch. So at least by encouraging them to take things, it keeps them as a people safe. The characters are going to remember this. So when I come back, they're going to know me as the mayor and they're going to know that I encourage them to steal. My only concern now is, will the simulation rise up against me? I mean, I would if you would like to join the rebellion, though, you'll need to check out campfire for it yourself. The links are down below. It's on Google Play. It's on android that's eventually coming to pc. I want na thank developers for reaching out. And if you would like to see a video where I don't convince an entire population to steal things from each other, it's right here. ",
