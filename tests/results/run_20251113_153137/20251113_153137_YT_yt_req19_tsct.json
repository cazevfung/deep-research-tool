  "content": "A lot of major game studios are investing in generative AI as the future of gaming, and it could not come slower. Fortnite just released its first AI character, Darth Vader. With the permission of the James Earl Jones estate, now Darth Vader can rip with you while you're playing Fortnite. Show the others what a Family Guy can do. Mommy ASMR, Taco Bell. And it's gone perfectly horribly for everybody to be talking about it. He's not supposed to be saying a lot of the things he's saying. Goon and edge foot fetish riz hawk tua edging and gooning hawk tua miku miku beam big dildo freaking [ __ ] such vulgarity does not become unique. I'm being told this is what the future of gaming looks like. Microsoft promises in the future project muse will be able to artificially generate new gameplay experiences based on the player. But right now it looks like sludge. This isn't a game. This is a visual approximation of a stroke. Outside of these little experiments, right now, AI can't really create games. But that hasn't stopped the worst of us from trying with loweffort AI products infecting nearly every single gaming platform, bringing such hits to the Xbox as Mario Stro Strikers. Huh? I would not blame you if you looked at this and thought it was a ripoff of Nintendo's Super Mario Strikers. But the cover itself is misleading. The game itself recycles stock video game assets that look nothing like Mario. They couldn't even get Mario Stro. Mario Stro Strikers was quickly removed from the Xbox store after making headlines. But that's not always the case. Nintendo had to deny that they're using generative AI and the upcoming Mario Kart World game. Because generative AI art is becoming harder to discern from the human-made art it's imitating. Nintendo has taken a pretty bold stance when it comes to using generative AI in development of its games because it's clearly of an inferior quality. But if you look at the Nintendo eShop, you would not know that. It's filled with so many garbage quality games that use misleading AI cover art or that uses AI assets to build most of the game. This is Motorcycles World Champions. First of all, look at this car. It's not a racing game. It's a racing visual novel. Splatters, Gymlifting Hero. These are some of the cheapest games to ever exist ever, but they are so prevalent when you are browsing for games on every major platform. Nintendo has tons of games with the word hentai right in the title which features AI generated soft porn right on the Nintendo eShop. Seagoy girls deli darling hentai girls daring detective anime girls royal romance bouncy basketball juicy judo pissy pirate hentai girls pissy pirate in the Nintendo eShop. Oh my god. These are going to have the AI acting up. Is this how we keep the machines under control? Henti Stewartist Girls features a 12piece jigsaw puzzle. That's not even a hard jigsaw puzzle. That is not the size of a jigsaw puzzle that a grown-up would do. It truly feels like they are targeting kids whose parents haven't activated the parental controls with an eShop card to spend. And the Sony PlayStation store looks exactly the same. It's a barren wasteland of AI shovelware. Therapist simulator. AI therapy is like Better Help with a crackpipe prescription. Okay, never mind. In this game, you are the therapist for your AI patients. What are they like? Yeah, this is Bill. And what the [ __ ] was that? AI has been used to turbocharge garbage on the biggest digital platforms around. There are dozens and dozens of these kinds of games coming out all the time. So, I've spent like seven hours of my life looking at a bunch of them because I want to illustrate that games can be quality checked. You're telling me if I worked in a coffee shop, this beautiful AI girl will be there. And then I want to discuss all the biggest digital platforms out there for games. the Nintendo eShop, the PlayStation Store, the Xbox store, the Epic Store, Steam, and how these platforms policies fail and are able to be abused and taken advantage of by the people making this AI slop. So, today we're gaming with the worst of them. Generating good health is no game. There's nothing artificial about that intelligence, which is why I'm happy to be talking about today's sponsor, Grunes. Little gummy bears that pack a vitamin punch with no artificial colors or flavors. While most multivitamins only contain about 7 to nine vitamins, Gruns has over 20 vitamins and minerals and over 60 whole foods ingredients. Since there are so many nutrients to get from these guys, there are eight gummies in each daily snack pack. That's right, a snack pack. They're a tasty, fun treat. It's tangy. And I really love the little bear shape. It's so nostalgic. Ground gummies are not multivitamins. They're not even a green gummy or a prebiotic. All of these things and more at a fraction of the price. Did you know not every supplement, greens, powder, or multivitamin measures their doses effectively? Grun has an accurate and effective nutrition label with all-included vitamins at 100% of their daily recommended value and minerals at 25%. Totally safe. All right, what vitamins and minerals are we talking here? Guns has biotin and hair for healthy skin and vitamin D, which if you're an indoor kid like me, you really need. Oh, you need super mushrooms to support brain and good gut health and vitamin C. That's a good one. If you want to start feeling as good as that little bear, you can get up to 52% off of your first Gruns order. Just click the link in the description or in the pin comment to get your gummies today. And now that we've had our vitamins, back to the slop. As it exists now, AI has only started to crack the mimicry of 2D imagery. So many games that predominantly use generated assets are very limited, such as puzzle games. There are dozens which literally collect jigsaw puzzles featuring AI generated images. Puzzle adventure farm animals cost $6.99, which is at least $100 more than it's worth. A step above AI jigsaw puzzles, we have AI visual novels. Not only do these game devs have to generate an image, but a script, too. Currently, there's one publisher on the Nintendo eShop that is just pumping these things out. Aldora Games. They have 113 titles they've released generating such hits as Guardians of Time, The Chronicles of Kronos, Animal Quest, The Battle for Green Hollow, but I had to give my money to Super Bunnies, Scarlet Wonder Ninjas. Not only is it infringing on Narudo's copyright, but the Easter Bunnies, too. No wonder why the New Pope just cracked down on AI. You going to go to hell for super bunnies? In this story, three young bunny ninjas have to leave the Carrot Valley and travel to the big city to get the crystal carrot from the evil Mr. Raccoon. I wanted to die playing this straight up. This AI is going to generate me a funeral. The setup is given in the prologue as I described it, but then chapter 1 starts and it just repeats everything all over again, reintroducing the location and the characters. They leave the valley to travel to the big city to get the crystal carrot twice. Are you with me? The journey to get to the big city just features some AI generated backgrounds and they reiterated that this tough journey leaving the valley is worth it because going to the big city is important to get the crystal carrot from Mr. Raccoon. I really expected more from the Super Bunny Scarlet Wonder Ninjas. The dumbest kid on the planet wouldn't with this game, but the smartest gooner would love date with a psycho killer girl. A love story and horror show series. Who's generating these titles? I really thought it would be funny to read what the AI had written, like reading a bad fanfiction, but this was not the case at all. The text is so vapid and so drawn out that it quickly loses any sense of irony. Blackwood is a scary ghost girl. She's talking about how she's haunting this house and how she's in every dark corner of the house and how the house has a way of devouring you. It's all about haunting the house. Except this speech is given on a highway. Finally, I met Ro Santa, the Joker girl. Oh boy. Do you know what amuses me? The only thing she doesn't joke about is chaos. The only way out is to surrender to the chaos. Every time you get closer, the chaos will grow stronger. Disordered chaos. The good thing about chaos is that everything is unpredictable. I want to be a part of your chaos. Backgrounds, characters, and most likely the text are all generated, but it still takes effort to compile it all. It's very hard for me to imagine that even with the assistance of AI, this is still worth it for somebody who is buying this stuff. Therapist Simulator on the PlayStation 5 was straight up an assault on my mental health. They took the extra effort of animating the characters talking. Isabelle from Animal Crossing, you have to lawyer up because they stole your whole flow. This one client is a streamer who is depressed. His friends only want to hang out with him while he's streaming, like they want to be on his stream and steal his clout. It's the only thing he talks about. It never progresses. He sounds like that the whole time. And any responses to his statements seem to have complete random effects on his happiness. The only good part about all this [ __ ] is after work there's like a blackjack miniame and you can burn all your cash and all your stress from dealing with these clients gambling. So I thought that was pretty funny. But I just cannot imagine that there are enough people out there buying this kind of software to make it lucrative enough for it to be soing much. The most elaborate attempt to create a game using AI generated assets that I was able to find was on the Epic Game Store. Doge 2042, a point-and-click adventure game that's free because somehow it integrates NFT and blockchain experiences for for money. The environments, character voices, and cutscenes are all generated, and you can tell. I don't think the scripting is done by AI just because there's this weird fixation with the main character disguising her sex toys as dog toys for her dog. And he talks and he knows it. All the toys in here are Lua's, not mine, I swear. And of course, it's a Shea Enu. The humor around the game is totally stuck in that 2016 meme culture that tech bros seem to love so much. It's a world run by crypto and AI. and in this world that the these geeks want. Somehow the government kills this woman's dog anyways, which doesn't make any of these things seem good. The game generated so much imagery that at least three hurricanes in the next 10 years are directly responsible because of this. This game's individual climate impact. This isn't a carbon footprint. This is a carbon crater. But no matter how elaborate and how many AI generated images and sounds they stitch together, I leave these experiences feeling so unfulfilled. Yo, can anyone hear me? Welcome. Um, come find me for all your side bet commentary needs. This is who made the game. So, let's change it up. Karaoke Party Sing and Dance. That's an AI title if I've ever heard one. Another hit classic by Aldora Games. This one is not a visual novel, but rather it is a karaoke game featuring AI generated music. The worst part is the karaoke text has no time marker, so you can't possibly sing along to these kill me tracks. These killer tracks ride across. The best part is that every animal does the same exact dance and when they stop dancing, they look so pissed off at you. You really feel guilty for making them listen to one of the 25 generated songs? I'd be pissed, too. And not just for those pirates. Pissy pirates. As it stands right now, I think the biggest problem facing these digital marketplaces is AI being used to generate misleading covers for loweffort junk software. The people most hurt by this are indie developers. Now games risk having their reputation ruined just for being cheap. Because this shovelware comes in and tries to mimic popular games, especially indies, with lowquality ripoffs that are increasingly more often using AI to trick consumers. Unpacking is a popular indie title, but several ripoffs were quickly created, all with AI generated covers. Stray was an indie darling lifted up by the major publishers. But those same publishers do nothing to prevent ripoffs like little strays from being displayed prevalently on their publisherowned storefronts. Cabin Crew Simulator became flight attendant simulator on board tasks. And I could no longer tell you which shop simulators are supposed to be the good ones. Fortunately, the ones with AI covers make it easy to spot which ones are definitely the bad ones. They can't keep these things off the shelves. But like the devil and your ex, AI and copyright infringement walk hand in hand. Obviously, AI models are built off scraping copyrighted material. And yes, I've heard people play devil's advocate, saying that there's no way the output of an AI model will have enough of an individual copyrighted work that it will be infringing on that work. but to play devil's advocate for the corporation. If the models are trained off of entire catalogs of content owned by a few big companies, how could they not be infringing on somebody's copyright? AI could not mimic the Pixar or Studio Ghibli art style without heavily referencing the cataloges of their work significantly. Its ability to mimic an original work always requires the original. If you want AI to generate something that sounds like a popular pop song, it's going to reference popular pop music, a genre which is really owned and controlled by a small group of people. And if we let AI models steal their work, what in turn is going to stop big companies from using AI models to steal work from somebody smaller? That's already happening. The hypers scale data centers required to power generative AI models are projected to scale at a rate that will consume more energy than the Earth's power grids currently are capable of producing. And God knows what that means for the environment. But that AI is literally going to compete with human beings for fresh water. Sometimes it really feels like we are burning the wick from both ends. And for what? Super ninja bunnies. While researching this, I've seen a few indie developers say that they've used generative AI art because they could not afford to commission the art they wanted. But that earns me no sympathy because of two examples. The first being One Punch Man, the beloved manga, which is adapted from a shitty little web comic that people love. A web comic drawn by the creator that can't draw for but he enjoys making a story so much he does it anyways. Toby Fox is an amazing composer, but he's not a very good pixel artist, but Undertale looks charming. A good concept mixed with a flawed human execution will always be infinitely more appealing than whatever overly rendered garbage AI is putting out. As of right now, there's not a single way generative AI has made the arts better. But AI is here to stay. Hopefully, we'll find a way to regulate it in such a way that it can be used ethically and sustainably. So its benefits to humankind and the planet can be maximized while reducing its harms. But before that happens, it really does feel like AI is a big fat pair of gator jaws ready to snap down on us. Major consequences await is what I'm saying. We're running into that [ __ ] like wy coyote running into the side of a mountain with an AI generated landscape painted on. You know, it really wouldn't be too hard to generate one alpha brand safe white boy YouTuber. After that, the rest of my life is bindle and train car simulator, if you know what I'm saying. In the meantime, the best many of us can do is just support humanmade art. But something I believe corporations should do right now in a small actionable way that really won't hurt their bottom dollar, but could positively impact the bottom dollar of indies, is to police their digital games platforms better. Nintendo, PlayStation, Epic, Steam, and Microsoft all have different policies on how to deal with loweffort software, and clearly some work better than others. Both the PlayStation Store and the Nintendo eShop are Helltown Ohio. I feel like we have to start with the eShop just because of how surprising it is to see so many titles with the word hentai in the title. There are too many anime girls with huge artificials on the eShop. Wouldn't it just be far better for Nintendo and PlayStation's reputation just to not allow these kinds of games in particular on the shop? Like, there's a place for that. I don't think it's Nintendo. That's like wearing a hentai shirt at Disney. I've seen it. It's not classy. Nintendo, you're supposed to be classy. Rebecca Valentine at IGN spoke to several anonymous sources publishing games on major platforms regarding Nintendo. One source said, \"I could make fart booby fart the game, and maybe it would eventually get taken down.\" Nintendo has tried to make changes to limit visibility of this software, but their eShop is easy to game. With new releases and games on sale given increased visibility, and if you think this problem will be fixed with the Switch 2, then welcome to Nintendo. I assume it's your first day here. Allegedly, Microsoft is the only major digital storefront that quality checks everything on a titlebytitle basis. And while they don't catch everything, the effort makes for a much better customer experience. Even if Mario sometimes slips on through and says, \"Here I go.\" There is concern from indie developers that major companies pleasing their distribution platforms has not come without flaw and that good games with honest to goodness human-made art may be flagged as AI generated but a better effort must be made. There is a lot of garbage on Steam but just through browsing good curation protected me a lot from slop content. The Epic Game Store is a whole other animal and has embraced the rogues gallery, AI, NFTTS, crypto, with AI especially bleeding heavily into their flagship game, Fortnite, where loweffort AI generated content is monetarily supported by Fortnite's creators program. These game modes are total [ __ ] posts, and it introduced me to the horror of AI memes such as the Italian brain group. This is the future AI has brought. All right. I was playing with one other person in this game. We had to go upstairs to escape tralero trala's house. Trolero. Trola. Wa. I just learned that that's a shark with shoes and he's upstairs with a big hammer. The other person I was playing with must have been 5 years old or the person who made this game or both because they kept waiting behind me and making me go upstairs to sneak past trolero all by myself. This game does not attract the brightest bulbs in the box. Me included. Worst of all, they tried friending me after the game. Like, don't push trao troll la in front of me and say you want to be my friend afterwards. I'm smarter than that. So, why do I bring up Fortnite? Because other games have incorporated userenerated content into their schemes, like Skyrim, which has banned AI generated content from being monetized. It can be done. Figure it out, guys. And if any of you consumers need me to give these big companies another talking to, please subscribe, comment down below, and like this video. And if you want to support us directly, you can go to hipster.com, which redirects directly to my Patreon. That's pretty nifty. And also, we're going to start giving shoutouts to our hipster gold members at the end of our video, and we're going to do verbal shoutouts for the first 10. So, shout out to Wasin on. That's it. Thank you. We're also still working on the Digimon podcast. I swear it's still coming. It's all homegrown user generated content, not our officially intellectually generated content. Takes time sometimes. So anyways, see you",
