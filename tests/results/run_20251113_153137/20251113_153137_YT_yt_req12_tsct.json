please take a look hey Jen how are you unfortunately not so good how come I worried about the crime around here it's gotten bad lately my Ramen Shop got caught in the crossfire can I help if you want to do something about this I have heard rumors that the powerful Crim Lord Kuman ioki is causing all sorts of Chaos in the city he may be the root of this violence I'll talk to him where can I find him I have heard he hangs out in the underground fight clubs on the city's East Side try there okay I'll go be careful Kai hey Mattel what's the location and objective of my next mission the next mission is located at the eye of misra players need to acquire the key and upload it to the main console since the mission requires faster delivery and upload of the key than the enemy having a highly maneuverable striker in your party would enhance your chances of success what should I consider when choosing a striker for this mission when choosing a striker for this Mission consider its Speed and Agility a fast and agile Striker would be ideal for this Mission which Striker fights the fastest the fastest Striker is the Falcon it features a high-speed Falcon form and can outperform other Strikers in terms of flight control and tactical flexibility I'd like to use the vcum for the mission sure Falcon is a capable Striker that can handle a variety of missions great I want to make sure I look good on the battlefield could you switch the paint to White Ang go let's go ahead and swap out the paint job for a brighter Style okay I'm ready for battle great just remember to keep your head

Works in conjunction with large language models and so historically this has meant that we had to rely on Computing the cloud that's why we partnered with Nvidia to create a version of dead meat that can be run locally on device this involved fine-tuning an Nvidia a small language model using our own data then integrating that model with our game conscious system which is ultimately what directs the characters in the game as as a result we've managed to retain the same quality of character responses that we were achieving in the cloud but now it's all running on a GeForce RTX GPU how would
