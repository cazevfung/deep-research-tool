  "content": "The earth's mightiest heroes, the guardians of the globe. Who are yall supposed to be guarding? The goal is wide open villain ciall is an and one mixtape barbecue chicken every single time. Am I supposed to see immortal and feel safe? Look at him. The good people requested a video on immortal, and I said, I'll do y'all one better. I'll give you authe guardians. Why? Because I care about jman. This one's from my baby girls. I see your comments, ladies, and they make me smile. I'm and ask for the guardians if I'm being honest. They aren't giving me much to look at here. A lot of them just got murked by omniman in episode one. And that was it. That fight with omniman was tragic, but I will say they went out worse in the comics. They didn't even get their little, Oh, we beat omni man within an inch of his life and Yeah, we gave him a concussion. No, they got one page, one page. And that was it. In the comic, omni man didn't even go to the hospital after he went straight back home and started beating Debbie's donies down. Now let's take a closer look at the guardians, starting with we got diet Batman. Look, I'm a bigger Batman fan than anybody. He's literally me. But how can you seriously say that a Batman versus Superman fight goes any differently than this dark wing? Looks like Chris Rock in a Batman costume from team move. What are you supposed to be exactly? What is a dark wing? Hoverboard man was just subway surfing around against the motwins and he had to get saved by omniman. Omniman saved your life with ease, and then he took your life with ease in the same episode omniman owns you say Doda, buddy. Dark wing might not have had wings, but in his final moments he took flight and he became the dark wig he was always meant to be. Why would you, as a person with no ability to fly, try and attack someone who can fly from the air? Omniman doesn't even need to pivot to change directions midair. Can't do that. That made me realize that omni man, would Loki be an insane defender in any sport? But you thought, hmm, let me just jump at him. Yeah, your name is dark wing, but you can't fly, buddy. And what goes up must come down. Dark wing two was originally dark wing sidekick night boy. Wait, I'm sorry, night boy. Someone has definitely called me to in middle school at the lunch table as an insult. I'm putting night boy right next to moon cricket. These are the same genre of phrase. This isn't subtle at all. So you're telling me dark wing two, aka night boy, lives in midnight city and takes you to the shadow realm. I beg your party. I beg you. Yeah, he murdered a bunch of people, but he also has a cool domain expansion, and he sacrificed himself to get lenless invincible. So you know what? W redemption and W hero, the CEO of company incorporated, arrives to battle war. Woman really becrunching niggers with this ball. Every time she hits somebody, we get a nice juicy sound effect. That's as the CEO of company incorporated, she didn't care about the shareholders and said she wanted her product to be rolled out for free in order to help people in need. So you're telling me you don't care about the shareholders in this economy? Yo, dump all her furight now. Bro, dump it all. Hey, you know me about people gave money. Now she acting funnow. She don't care about us. Us, the stockholders, man, I don't care about the nickers with diseases, and I'm sick too. I got aids. All I desire is stock. Her conversation is cut short when she gets a notification on her Fitbit telling her that the ops are sliding. Her helmet really reminds me of, you know, she did piece omniman a little bit and give him a concussion, which I can respect. And she's really sticking it to big pharma. W hero, Hey, look, there's a torto behind you where I don't see it behind you. Look, European guy with super speed. This guy was really Russian. Am I right? I actually remembered Red Russia's name, and I have terrible memory. So that means he really left a print on me. Unfortunately, he went out sad like everyone else on his team. See, in my head, I had thought that he was hanging with omni man like a little bit at first. Then I realized the fight and realized, no, that did not happen at all. He got his melon pop so fast that his team of the strongest superheroes on earth couldn't even react to it. And they were already in fight mode at that point. And they're in the same room. How long do you think it would take for immortal than them to reach the other side of this room where omni man is crushing his skull? They are superhuman. It would not take long at all. See, we're watching this happen in slow motion, but in real time, red rush probably got packed in like 1s one, and it was the immortal probably blinked and his home boy was a juice box. If your man's gets marked in 2s, he did not put up a fight. He went out absolutely terrible and unliked red rush too. He saved Helen people against the muler twins. But when red rush got his head red, crushed him and turned into red gushing, and they had to red scrub him with a red brush. I'm gonna a red shush. Stop, wait a minute. Get a good look at this ugly ass hokemon. Oh, omni man, this is second. Everybody let me spray him with water. What are you doing? Look how serious he looks. You're not getting anything done. You gotta be the diversity higher on this team. This dumbass tellapia thinking he's putting in work. You know what he was doing before they called him into work today? Literally nothing. He was just sitting in a chair in a dark room, waiting for his name to be called. Is there nothing to do in Atlantis? Is there no entertainment? No sexy fish? Huz, you can't mess with a bfw. I will say this though. I feel like if Atlantis was real fish, people would look more like professor tilapia then Jason Momoa. Having a human body and living underwater, that' S Goto be mid as hthousands of years of living in the ocean, I think would evolve to have fins and gills, not red hair, and wear tight Green clothes and be Amber heard, didn't she, on a bed? Oh my God. Omniman just hit Green ghost with a five knuckle shuffle. You know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna spray water at him and and make stupid fish. Nobecause, I'm a stupid fish. Just listen to the sound he makes. Oh. Fuyo omniman just trickshot at this guy. This is some mlg shit right here. Look at this. War woman's mace was spinning in the air. He snagged it out the sky like oddel Beckham and marked this fish in one clean motion. He's got to get bonus points for that. You know what I actually feel kind of that I said mean things about you, fisherman. And now you're gone and I feel guilty. Maybe you are a fish and maybe you do make stupid noises, but what you do isn't simple. You're a hero. You're so sophisticated. When evil was at our door and things got fishy, you were there to protect us. Always thinking of others, cause you're not shellfish. I mean, salmon had to do it. And Yeah, how many men hit you in the head? And he klled you. But you'll live on forever because to me, you are absolutely fantastic. Green ghost in the big summer of 2025. Whatever man here. She's a fashion designer, photographer, person. And when she gets called into the guardian's hq for the final time, she pops up. I'm not even gonna to call that a perk that looks like a marble and her suit. What is this? Shorty is a walking Green screen. How lazy can you get? You can't put a letter, a design, something, anything. No, she just wanna walk around and like, what do you even call this thing? She's wearing this full body, non breathable, no holes. Is this like a freaky thing? How is the fashion designer walking around in the worfit? I goto admit even the Fishman through a lasome Mont, and I hate him. Do better. She puup to guardian 's hq, and omniman saw she has something in her team, her powers. She can go through things, except for omniman's fist, which went through her these jokes, for they right themselves, man, she didn't contribute at all in the fight with omniman, even a little bit. Even fish boy sprayed omniman with water and dark wing, I guess, showed us his impressive vertical jump one last time, which is slightly more than nothing. I mean, they both did nothing too, but Green ghost, all she really did was catch her home boys corpse, say, Oh no, and then omniman punch straight through her head. Shorty asis terrible if you don't at least face through his first punch. I get hit with the second one or something. Oh, you're sorry, the immortal, or as I like to call him, the convertible because he's always dropping the top off. The baby convertible memes might be before your time if you are a Young one. If I had a dollar for every time this guy got beheaded, I'd have about eight doleight dollars. Eight doleight dollars, $8. His decapitated head is a backbling in Fortnite. That means his biggest can walk around with his head on his back and do the gritty. Mr. President omniman is busting a down sexual style. So apparently he was a caveman then he was a knight. Immortal was also Abraham Lincoln. He freed the slaves. Okay, I see you. My question is why yyou wait so long man nano no, no not as don't get fly Abraham Lincoln my ass. Slavery had gone on for hundreds of years at this point. Transit letting slave trade der you wish what you was just chilly. What was you doing? Oh, Oh, now you want to speak up. Immortal Abe Lincoln. Man, mortal, just be a warcharpretend. He's busy, bro. Straight ay scam is csel out that paycheck. Where's omnman? He's here and now you're dead. He was crashing out. Thatlose his mind. Go in santhen duplicate pulled up. Put that lip bang on. Hey, you right? Is rain telling me all he needed was some vshand? Now he's mismello. That's Chris. She got the cure for insanity in that box because we see what happens when immortal loses her. But this couple has the most diabolical age difference I've ever seen. She wasn't old enough to see micjackson. He was old enough to see Michelangelo. What are yall gonna talk about? A lot of people online don't like immortal. They call him things like mid mortal fraud hipocal. Why does he get to crack Kate? It's not. I feel like we're asking a mortal to do a little too much. He signed up to fight humans, not bill tramites. That's a whole new can of worms. Like when they let black people first join the nbeight. Man, these mailmen and plumbers were not ready for Wilt Chamberlain. He scored 100 points, 100 points. But I see why people hate immortal though. He's always walking around acting tough, getting in people's faces. Game. Just stop. That's not your body, roenough. After all that talking he did when mark choked out Cecil right in front of him, all of a sudden it's real quiet. The memes that came from this were hilarious. You should check. Ok, him up. But after a very long career of losing practically every fight he's ever fought and constantly acting out whenever Kate isn't putting it on him, he said, enough, I'm gonna take my lugirlfriend and we gonna retire ggs. And you know what? If I was him and I got a Shorty that can call on herself, man, I'm editor too. Why am I fighting these random dudes? Get him brain damage, bro. I'm done. Peep Donald's reaction to immortal saying, he gave this world enough. Glad to have you back, immortal. No, no, I'm done. I've given this world enough. So if I'm understanding this correctly, she is an abg and her superpower is that she can become two abgs don't want to are me, don't speak. And her name is duplicate ate yknow somebody was in a nobody be. I'm pretty sure her and a mortal are going band for band to see who can be the most hated in the show. But one thing about Kate, she will get torn to shreds in every fight. If a villain as much as sneezes in her direction, she is in pieces. Chty is made up tissue paper. And another thing, when Rex cheated on eve with Kate, everyone was like, yo, Rex, you weird. We hate you and rightfully so. But nobody was mad at Kate at all. I'm looking at you too. Eve is your home girl and you slimming her out for no reason. I heard duplicating on Rex, you're a freka. And then she went a few episodes later and duplicated on the mortal two. I she loved getting busy at that shower at work. Take over freakieyes home makes a serious case for the most useless character of the year. I can't think of a single time where the good guys were pushed to the edge and Kate came through and just started. Hoher brother uses his powers way better, even though he's also mad at a tissue paper. Must be a family traduplicate credit rate meditate, wolves. Here we have a robot named robot. I would be honest at first, he was hella cool. Now after this last season, I am not messy with bro. So Redies right. Tell me why at this man's funeral, he's thinking, hmm, how can I make this about me? He gonna say, yo, in order to honor Rex's legacy, don't call me Rudy. Call me Rex now. Yo, nobody asked you to do this. No, Angel, not fooling us. We already know you wanted to be him. Nika, you cloned him. We not buy in that honoring his legacy gimmick. Hail. No. And you're doing this at his funeral while you look like him when he was a kid. May g get the out of here. He really cloned his coworker cause monster girl thought Rex was hot. What kind of is that to do that is actually so strange. So you're telling me he had a crush, and in order to crush his crush, he made himself a clone of his crushes. Crush, not a hibro and a crush. His master plan is to be a twelve year old boy so he can date monster girl and not get looked at weird and public. I, bro, you wanna be a little kid, right? Even though you a grown ash Mary, right? You wanna be a look, I, you can't stay up past nine lonona and give me that phone too. My emission parameters require guys, what did I say about talking back to me? Huh? G, what did I say about talking back to the boy? The black lightning guy? No, not that one. Or that one? Not that one either. No, not that one. Not him either. How many of these guys are? No, not that one. Not him. Is that me? There we go. Black Samson. Black Samson is such a chat. Look at the way he wins the fight and then goes over to the loser to help them up. Very mindful, very demure. He's an excellent leader, a fearless warrior, a respected veteran, an inspiration to us all, a hero. And he's mold. He's very, very bald. And he's voiced by cyborg duay. We're not the best superhero team on the planet. That's great. You know how hard it is to clean in between my sensitive, I don't know why I decided to glaze this guy. Maybe it's cause he's my evil twin. He really hasn't done anything. He's kind of trash actually. But black Simpson, Oh, black Simpson, he was special. Monster girls situation is so bizarre. It feels to me like she got hit with one of those would you rather questions that people used to ask the really weird ones. Would you rather be able to turn into a monster? But after every time you get younger or get a job, the monster girl is a 24 year old woman that looks twelve years old. Personally, I had the opposite problem. When I was twelve, I looked 24. She was cursed by her lover's grandma cause granny ain't approve of their relationship. Firstly, hating as grandma and too and what are you doing? But more importantly for grandgrandto, put a curse on her just for dating her grandson. Man, 'muster girl was probably known in that town precurse love. First time we've seen her, she was meet watching Rex. Isn't there a size requirement? I really don't have much to say about monster girl. She's kind of just there. She's not weaenough for me to really make fun of her, but she's not strong enough for me to care. But you know what? I'm the pro hater and I have a job to do. So I'll see a few words. Monster girl is Green and stupid like Shrek. That was he talking about. Hey, monster girl, I think I think you're stupid with your eyes, right? Monster girls voice, actress voice azulla. I had a crush on azulla when I was younger. About nice. Hey, Greg Griffin was good Martian man. His biggest achievement was holding down omni man for a little bit while a mortal and war woman got some legs in that and stretching himself to his limits with this homeless little girl. I never expanded myself to that extent. That was intense. This little girl then proceeds to join the order. How did she go from being homeless in the slums to being a high ranking member of the Chinese mafia? Aw, come up though, sister. I'm be honest. I don't really care for Martian man at all. He's got a big ass head and he's chopped my goat. Shake Smith is so clear. Shakesmih is low key. The goat. He's easily a top five invincible character. No, I'm not joking. This guy y's legit hilarious. Everything he does, everything he says. Y'all remember when he ran on the treadmill backwards? Or probably the funniest moment, inevincible, is when he's telling the story of how he came to earth. The best part of it all is that he thinks he's so slick, like he's convinced he's blended in human society completely. Nobody suspects him. Shapes Smith, my glorious king, they can never make me hate you and he Loki slit on power play don't play with him real goat talk Oh so bulletproof how you been Browsky you still do that one thing that you do and over by the Yeah that's it's been going good I'll be honest bulletproof is good cardio I wonder if theyadapted storyline from the comics cause it was pretty wild we might come back and revisit this then but for now amazing cardio yo what's up ray how you how you been you still you still do the the one thing by the Yeah Yeah that's nice I'm gonna be honest before Rex Risher up man I barely even notice she was there kodos I'm not even hating I just don't really remember her speaking ever I stood up in applauded when she blew that one to his head up from the inside that was pever not right you were stay safe on her man no rfp Goat Man rest of power man this man grew so much from when we first met him you the real Rex not that freak that cloned you and stoyour name and people sleep on how clean Rex's record is by the way this man has never lost and is amazing in the clutch may he clushed that little leadope with a bullet in his head man with no hell they have get his respect and he killed. An invincible variant. Tell me that's not amazing. Hoops. He's one of like very few people to do that. Rex, you tough. You're him, bro. You are a real niggo, bro. You are also the most racially ambiguous character I've ever seen. Where do where? Where where are you from? Where would I find people that look like you? Can we just have a brief moment of silence in honor of my boy? Reexplode? Thank you all for watching. ",
